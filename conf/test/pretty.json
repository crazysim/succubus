He's a surprisingly good interviewer, and a different sort of interviewer than Terry Gross. He's IN there, telling lots of stories of his own, comparing experiences. After all, he's just as famous as many of the guests. It makes for unusual and often very compelling listening. Some of my favorites: <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/193354-herb-alpert/\">Herb Alpert</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/216217-david-letterman/\">Letterman</a> (who admits to Alec he doesn't work hard any more on his show, and who so loves the interview at the end he says something like \"Wait, it's over? So soon?\"), <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/225651-billy-joel/\">Billy Joel</a> (a Long Island on Long Island gabfest at the piano). Archive <a href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/episode-archive/\">here</a>.  \n\n<p />Glad he's making more of them.

One of the <em>Car Talk</em> guys, Tom Magliozzi, is dead at 77.  I only ever met Tom and Ray a few times, mostly in the first year or two of our show. They had no reason to be nice to me but they were lovely and supportive.  When they announced their retirement two years ago, I <a href=\"http://www.current.org/2012/06/want-new-radio-hits-on-saturday-step-1-drop-car-talk-when-the-guys-retire/\">wrote an essay</a> for the public radio newspaper <em>Current</em>, which included this section, explaining how important their show has been to public radio.  They were the single most popular hour on public radio for years. Here's an excerpt:\n\n<p /><em>I enjoy </em>Car Talk<em>. I like those guys. And as a public radio lifer, I'm grateful for what Tom and Ray Magliozzi did to bring a vast audience to public radio, year after year.\n\n<p />They made our stations a destination for millions of radio listeners on Saturday mornings. They shoved public radio's sound away from stuffy and towards chatty. They loosened everyone's notion of what is possible or appropriate for a national show and \u2014 just as important \u2014 what could be a hit with our audience.\n\n<p />Without </em>Car Talk<em>, shows like mine would have had a much harder time getting onto stations, no question. The Car Guys and Garrison Keillor proved you can sound different, you can organize huge swaths of what you're doing around just being funny, you can think of your program first and foremost as entertainment, and audiences will show up in big numbers.\n\n<p />What they did was huge. Doug Berman does a canny, brilliant job producing them. Tom and Ray \u2014 like great ballplayers \u2014 are so phenomenally surefooted at what they do that they make it seem effortless. And they wear the mantle of success as lightly and gracefully as anyone could.</em>\n\n<p />Tom and Ray were kind enough to make appearances on our show three times.  In 1997 and 1998 we were still a pretty unknown show, and they were titans, iconic, one of the biggest shows on public radio.  It helped us seem legit to have them on, and I was grateful they made the time.  I recommend those appearances if you're a fan, because you hear a slightly different side of them than you do on their own show, especially the first time they came onto our program.  Those appearances:\n\n<p />In our <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/61/fiasco?act=2\">1997 Fiasco! episode</a>, they explained how hard it was to get their hit show onto the radio in Wisconsin.\n\n<p />In <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/215/ask-an-expert?act=0#play\">a 2002 show</a>, they explained how they screwed up repairing their own former employee's car, but maybe got him a girlfriend in the process.  That ex-employee btw is Joe Richman, the guy who went on to create the great <a href=\"http://www.radiodiaries.org/\"><em>Radio Diaries</em></a> series. \n\n<p />They helped me <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/94/how-to?act=1#play\">teach Sarah Vowell to drive a car</a> in 1998.  \n\n<p /><em>Image from <a href=\"http://www.cartalk.com/content/tom-magliozzi-through-years\"></em>Car Talk</a>."

The second series from <em>This American Life</em> is now officially not a dream but a thing that exists in the world. We have a spinoff! In fact, there are not one but two episodes, ready for you to hear.\n\n<p />To reiterate the facts in case you\u2019ve missed them till now: The new show is called <em><a href=\"http://www.serialpodcast.org\">Serial</a></em> and it\u2019s hosted by Sarah Koenig, who\u2019s done some of the most memorable stories ever on our show.\n\n<p />What\u2019s different about <em>Serial</em> is that it\u2019s a story that takes a dozen or so episodes to tell. So each new episode brings you the next chapter of this amazing, unfolding story. <em>Serial</em>\u2019s a podcast, not a radio show, because a podcast seems like a better place for a long story that you need to hear from the beginning. With podcasts, you can download everything and binge listen.\n\n<p />And yes, we know lots of people still aren\u2019t so clear what podcasts are or how to get them. If that\u2019s you \u2013 if you\u2019re an older person and the whole idea of learning about podcasts just makes you feel tired \u2013 have no fear! We have made an instructional video. It stars me and an actual older person, a friend of mine from the dog park, Mary Ahearn, who\u2019s in her eighties. She listens to our show every week on her iPad and in a minute and a half in this video, she explains everything you need to know. \n\n<p /><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"282\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/8IPV2oSz8m4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p />To listen to the first two episodes of <em>Serial</em>, go to <a href=\"http://www.serialpodcast.org\">Serialpodcast.org</a>.\n\n<p />We\u2019re all super-excited to finally be premiering our new show. It\u2019s been in the works for a year. Sarah is just fantastic in this new role. We truly and sincerely hope you like it."

It\u2019s so good! It\u2019s made by two of our longtime producers here \u2013 Sarah Koenig hosts and Julie Snyder produces \u2013 and it feels like the greatest stories we ever do on <em>This American Life</em> and it also feels like something totally new. \n\n<p />I\u2019m writing today to say it premieres on Friday October 3rd. It\u2019s called <a href=\"http://www.serialpodcast.org\"><em>Serial</em></a>. We\u2019re releasing not just one episode, but two episodes that day. You can subscribe to the series and hear a preview <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/serial/id917918570\">here</a>.  \n\n<p />Wait, did I bury the lede? Yes, this is our very first spinoff show! We have a spinoff! We\u2019re making two shows, not one! That\u2019s news, right? It\u2019s the first brand new show from the staff of <em>This American Life</em> since 1995. And yes \u2013 we\u2019re old. Sorry about that. And yes, this is not going to be on the radio. Podcast only! \n\n<p />We\u2019ve tried to continually reinvent how we tell stories on our show and this is the next step.  Instead of bringing you a new theme and a new set of stories each week the way we do on <em>This American Life</em>, Serial brings you back every week to the same story, to tell you the next chapter. Our hope is to give you the same experience you get from a great HBO or Netflix series, where you get caught up with the characters and the thing unfolds week after week, and you just <em>have</em> to hear what happens next, but with a story that\u2019s true. And no pictures. Like <em>House of Cards</em> or <em>Game of Thrones</em> but you can enjoy it while you\u2019re driving. \n\n<p />Each season of <em>Serial</em> will be a different story and the first season is about a murder. Sarah Koenig is \u2013 no question \u2013 the best radio reporter in the world for this job. Did you happen to catch the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/492/dr-gilmer-and-mr-hyde\">hour-long story</a> she did, where she re-investigated a murder committed by this doctor named Gilmer? I felt like every ten minutes, I learned something that changed my whole idea of the case and the story and in the end, she found exculpating facts nobody at the trial on either side knew about. It was perfect radio. It\u2019ll be amazing to hear Sarah do this once a week.\n\n<p /><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/serial/id917918570\">Subscribe now</a>, while you\u2019re thinking of it. Listen to the preview. You won\u2019t be sorry.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/serialstaff2.jpg\"><br />\nSerial <em>staff: Dana Chivvis, Emily Condon, Sarah Koenig, Ira Glass, and Julie Snyder. <br> Photo by Meredith Heuer.</em>"

He and his colleagues in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police pinned the crime on the wrong woman. Her name was Kim Crafton. It took Trainum ten years to realize that the confession he got from her was actually false. And that some of the interrogation techniques he used had caused it.\n\n<p />Crafton says she'd never heard him admit that his interrogation techniques led to a false confession before that story and last week, she filed a $5-million lawsuit against Trainum and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department for coercing her confession and false imprisonment. The <em>Washington City Paper</em> covered has more on the suit here: \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/looselips/2014/09/04/district-sued-over-this-american-life-revelations-of-false-confession/\">District Sued Over <em>This American Life</em> Revelations of False Confessions</a>.\""

So next week we premiere this show at Town Hall that combines radio stories and dance. Let me say first of all, I know that sounds awful. Radio stories and dance. But it\u2019s a show that's designed as this very funny entertainment, and it kills everywhere we take it.\n\n<p />You may have seen the dancers \u2013 Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass \u2013 at some of our live <em>This American Life</em> shows. The <em>New York Times</em> today describes their style as \"refreshingly relatable ... equal parts theater, movement, comedy, vaudeville, clowning and spectacle. Think of Buster Keaton in Vegas.\"\n\n<p />The show has stories about love and middle school and marriage and losing what you love, but as an interviewer suddenly thrown into the world of dancers, some of my favorite parts of the evening are these pieces which combine interviews I did with Monica and Anna about the job of being a dancer ... and dance. So we see Monica and Anna move and glide and turn as we hear them talk about what goes on in their heads while they\u2019re onstage.\n\n<p />The show\u2019s unlike anything else, and a total labor of love. You get only three chances to see it: Wednesday Thursday and Friday next week. Then \u2026 that's it! Never again! You'll have to live your life knowing you missed this very rare, fun thing we invented. \n\n<p />Today\u2019s <em>New York Times</em> does a better job explaining the show than I\u2019m doing right now. The story's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/arts/dance/three-acts-stars-ira-glass-and-monica-bill-barnes.html?_r=0\">here</a>. \n\n<p />Tickets are <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/promo/tfn346\">here</a>. \n\n<p />I'm very happy that our media partner for these shows is WNYC."

        "description": "<P />We aired a story in \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/530/mind-your-own-business\">Mind Your Own Business</a>\" about an FBI investigation of inmate abuse and corruption in LA County jails that escalated into a massive battle between the Feds and the LA Sheriff\u2019s Department. The most recent trial concluded with six sheriff\u2019s department officials convicted of obstruction of justice.\n\n<p />We asked the LA Sheriff\u2019s Department to send us a written statement about the changes the department has made since the investigation came to light three years ago.\n\n<p />Here\u2019s their full statement: <blockquote><p />In September, 2011, the first of two lawsuits was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documenting multiple allegations of deputy misconduct within the Los Angeles County Jail system.\u00a0The second lawsuit came in January, 2012, citing additional allegations.\u00a0In addition to this, Federal authorities initiated an investigation in the Los Angeles County Jail system, which prompted heavy scrutiny on the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s management of the jails.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<p />In response to these allegations, the Department immediately established a corrective action plan to address concerns about custody operations.\u00a0 Over the past few years, the Department has made a multitude of changes which have transformed the custody environment.\u00a0Some of these changes include innovative ideas which have not previously been implemented in large jail systems.\n\u00a0\n<P />The goal was to promote community trust, implement a force reduction plan, change the deputy culture in the custody environment, encourage respect based communications with inmates, review and implement new training for staff assigned to the jails, prepare and revise all directives/policies necessary to implement recommendations from outside entities, analyze force incidents, reduce inmate-on-inmate violence, and develop and implement a custodial career path for deputies.\n\u00a0\n<p />Some of those changes were:<ul>\n\u00a0\n<li>Creation of an Internal Criminal Investigations Bureau Task Force to investigate ACLU declarations and jail misconduct.</li>\n<li>Creation of the Commander Management Task Force to implement jail reforms.</li>\n<li>Creation of the Custody Force Rollout Team and the Custody Force Review Committee to improve investigations and the evaluation of force incidents.</li>\n<li>Immediate transfer of 19 sergeants and 2 lieutenants to Men\u2019s Central Jail for additional supervision.</li>\n<li>Complete revision of the Department\u2019s Force policies and included a Force Prevention policy.</li>\n<li>Creation of a Use of Force Manual.</li>\n<li>Initiation of Town Hall Meetings for inmates to voice their concerns directly to supervisors and facility management.</li>\n<li>Enhanced staff training for ethics, force prevention and dealing with the mentally ill.</li>\n<li>Appointment of a new Assistant Sheriff and management team for Custody Division.</li>\n<li>Expansion of the Education Based Incarceration program to help in rehabilitative efforts.</li>\n<li>Expansion of the Custody Training and Standards Bureau.</li>\n<li>Expansion of the Jail Mental Health Evaluation Team.</li>\n<li>Enhanced penalties for excessive force and dishonesty.</li>\n<li>Creation of the Internal Investigations Division, now known as Professional Standards Division.</li>\n<li>Creation of an internal audit unit known as the Internal Monitoring, Performance Audits and Accountability Command.</li>\n<li>Mandate daily review of all force by executives.</li>\n<li>Installation of a CCTV video system in Men\u2019s Central Jail, Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and the Inmate Reception Center and is currently adding additional cameras with a five-year installation plan for all jails.</li>\n<li>Prohibit the use of large flashlights and issued small, tactical flashlights to all Custody personnel.</li>\n<li>Implementation of a Dual Track career plan for sworn personnel which allows deputies to remain in a custody assignment their entire career if they choose.</li>\n<li>Mandate custody line personnel rotate assignments every six months within each facility.</li>\n<li>Revision or creation of over 70 policies.</li>\n<li>Purchase of Body Scanners for inmate searches. Two are being tested currently at the Inmate Reception Center.</li>\n<li>Implement 52 of 60 Citizens\u2019 Commission on Jail Violence recommendations.\u00a0 One is still in progress and the remaining seven are being worked on but require additional funding.</li></ul>\n\u00a0\n<p />As a result of the changes made, the Department has fundamentally changed the culture of the custody environment.\u00a0Use of force incidents have dropped significantly, in comparison to 2011 and earlier.\u00a0Civil lawsuits and claims from custody related incidents have also been reduced.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n<p />The Department continues to constantly evaluate all aspects of custody operations and is committed to changes that will enhance the Department, personnel and the community within the jails.</blockquote>"

So close! \u2013 at Town Hall on 43rd Street. Tickets <a href=\"http://3acts2dancers1radiohost.com/townhall/\">go on sale</a> today. \n\n<p />We\u2019ve been touring the show to a different city every month for about a year and we\u2019re excited to bring it to New York. It\u2019s brought down the house in LA, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Minneapolis, San Francisco, DC, Philly and Minneapolis. The show combines two things that, we know, have no business being together: dance and radio stories. \n\n<p />Tickets start at the low price of $25 and go up to $80.  There\u2019s also a <a href=\"https://www.trycelery.com/shop/mbbco\">VIP Ticket</a> that\u2019s basically a donation to the dance company, where you come to a small reception backstage before the show. \n\n<p />A trailer and more info are <a href=\"http://3acts2dancers1radiohost.com/townhall/\">here</a>."

We\u2019re starting a new show!  We\u2019ve never done this before.  It\u2019s coming out in the fall.  It\u2019s called <em>Serial</em> and it\u2019ll be a weekly podcast, not a radio show at all.  The main way it\u2019s different from <em>This American Life</em> is that instead of bringing you a different theme each week, every episode of <em>Serial</em> will bring you back not just to the same theme but to the same story, to bring you the next chapter. We\u2019re starting with a crime story, that\u2019ll run for about a dozen episodes. Our hope is that it\u2019ll play like a great HBO or Netflix series, where you get caught up with the characters and the thing unfolds week after week, but with a true story, and no pictures. Like <em>House of Cards</em>, but you can enjoy it while you\u2019re driving.</p>\n\n<p>The show\u2019s produced by <em>This American Life</em>\u2019s longtime senior producer Julie Snyder, and Sarah Koenig will host.  She\u2019s one of our show\u2019s producers and she is \u2013 no question \u2013 the best radio reporter in the world for this series. Regular listeners may remember the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/492/dr-gilmer-and-mr-hyde\">hour-long story</a> she did a while back, investigating a murder committed by this doctor named Gilmer. Every ten minutes, you learned something that changed your whole idea of the case and the story, and in the end, she found exculpating facts nobody at the trial on either side knew about. It was amazing reporting. I can\u2019t wait to hear Sarah do this once a week. Seriously &mdash; she\u2019s done some of the best stories we've put on the air: the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/489/no-coincidence-no-story\">Coincidences show</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/383/origin-story?act=1\">story</a> about her dad\u2019s career in the \u201cMad Men\u201d era of advertising, the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant\">episode</a> about the maintenance man in the Schenectady, NY schools who became a petty tyrant. She produced Jake Halpern's  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/360/switched-at-birth\">Switched at Birth story</a>, one of the show's most popular episodes.</p> \n\n<p>Even though Serial doesn\u2019t come out till fall, you can sign up for updates <a href=\"http://serialpodcast.org/#newsletter\">here</a>.</p>"

But here they were, all brought together in one show with dancers and musicians and TV/movie actors and radio people of course.

They'd heard HER singing the songs around the house and they picked it up like a virus.\n\n<p /><center><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21-chump-street-the-musical-ep/id892408890?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\"><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/chump420.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a></center><br  />\n\n<p />If the tunes also invaded your head the way a parasite enters a zombie mouse &mdash; and okay, there was probably a way to describe that process which wouldn't seem so menacing but I'm just gonna go with parasites and undead rodents &mdash; I have good news: the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/21-chump-street-the-musical-ep/id892408890?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\">Original Cast Album recording of \"21 Chump Street: The Musical\" just dropped</a>.

Last week we tried one of the most ambitious things we\u2019ve ever attempted: a show onstage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House with nearly 70 actors, singers, dancers and musicians, including some actual famous people, turning the kinds of stories we do every week into all sorts of incredibly fun performances onstage. And this Friday, you can see the video!\n\n<p />I\u2019ve always wanted us to do one of our stories as a musical and it was thrilling to see that finally happen. Lin-Manuel Miranda (who wrote the Broadway musical <em>In the Heights</em>) turned a piece of journalism &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/457/what-i-did-for-love?act=2\">story</a> you may remember from our show, about a high school kid who asks an undercover cop to the prom &mdash; into a full-on musical, with dancing and singing and everything, performed by an all-Broadway cast. It\u2019s amazing, and just hearing it on the radio, you'll miss the choreography which is non-stop for the entire thing, and the sets and costumes. Comedians Sasheer Zamata of SNL and Mike Birbiglia each did stories that brought down the house. Stephin Merritt from The Magnetic Fields plays songs. There were surprise cameos and so much more in this show but honestly I\u2019d rather say less to avoid spoilers. \n\n<p />It\u2019s really one of the best things we\u2019ve ever done. \n\n<p />And here\u2019s the big news that\u2019s the reason for this blogpost: This weekend, in addition to putting an hour-long version on the radio, we\u2019re trying this thing where you\u2019ll be able to SEE the show as well. We\u2019re doing it Louis CK-style: for just five bucks, you can download or stream video of the entire show. It includes over forty minutes of material we couldn\u2019t fit on the radio. \n\n<p />I hope you watch. If this works, and enough people download, it\u2019ll become something we can do again. Also: we\u2019re all super-proud of it. It\u2019s like any of the best episodes of our show, plus music and singing and acting and costumes and sets and dancing! \n\n<p />All this week, we\u2019ll post little previews to give you a sense of what it\u2019ll be."

        "description": "<p />Ira here. \n\n<p />A few months ago we announced that Public Radio International was no longer going to be our distributor, starting in July. Today we\u2019re announcing what we\u2019re doing instead.  It\u2019s this: we\u2019re going to distribute the show ourselves. \n\n<p />What\u2019s this mean to you? Nothing! <em>This American Life</em> will remain on the same radio stations at the same times. Our podcast and website will be unaffected in any way. The only thing that\u2019s different is the way we get the audio to your local public radio station. Public Radio International used to do that job for us. Now an outfit called Public Radio Exchange \u2013 PRX \u2013 will be delivering the audio files and billing stations. All the other things a distributor does \u2013 selling underwriting, encouraging stations to put our show on at better times \u2013 we\u2019ve hired people to do for us. Radio \u2013 and the technology of moving audio over the Internet \u2013 has changed so much that at this point, there\u2019s little a distributor can do for us that we can\u2019t do on our own.\n\n<p />This is more detail than you ever wanted to know about how a radio show gets on the air, right?\n\n<p />When word got out that PRI would no longer be our distributor, the most surprising call I got was from Sirius-XM satellite radio. They asked how much money it would take to get me to quit public radio completely, to abandon terrestrial radio the way Howard Stern did, and play exclusively on Sirius-XM. So flattering! But of course, no chance of that happening. For better or worse, I seem to be a public radio lifer.\n\n<p />We have no beef at all with our old distributor, PRI. They did a great job for us for a long time, and were lovely to work with too. They\u2019re smart and capable and great people to be in business with. When we first signed up with them in 1997, they doubled the number of stations carrying our show from around 110 to twice that in just three months, which was incredible.  \n\n<p />The company that\u2019s going to deliver the audio files of our show to stations, PRX, has this website (<a href=\"http://www.prx.org\">prx.org</a>, duh) where anyone can post a story or a full series and try to get radio stations to run it. What they\u2019re about is the democratization of public radio. Making it easy for you or any newcomer to get their work into the hands of program directors. I admire that. They also try to bring new voices onto the air with projects like the Public Radio Talent Quest, which they did a few years ago and which led to the creation of <em>Snap Judgment</em> and <em>State of the Re:Union</em>. Apparently we\u2019ll be the biggest show on PRX, and I\u2019m glad that in some small way this may help them popularize the PRX platform as a way to deliver programming. When you get tired of being a listener and decide to make your own show, seriously, you should give them a look. \n<p />- Ira\n<p />\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL_distribution_press_release.pdf\">PRESS RELEASE</a>"

        "description": "<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/m_anderson_edit.jpg\"><br />\n<em>Mike at home with his wife, LaQonna, right after he was released. </em>\n\n<p />A few months ago in our \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/518/except-for-that-one-thing\">Except for That One Thing</a>\" show, we ran a story about a man named Mike Anderson. In 2000, he was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 13 years in prison. But he never went to prison. Law enforcement should have picked Mike up, but for reasons that are still unclear, that never happened. So during those 13 years he turned his life around: he got married, became a father of four and started his own business. He never had another run-in with the law.\n\n<p />The Missouri Department of Corrections only realized its mistake when they were preparing to release Mike from prison last July. At that point, he was re-arrested and put in jail.  \n\n<p />Reporter Jessica Lussenhop talked to Mike for our story when he was about five months into his sentence and uncertain of his future.\n\n<p />But yesterday, she was in a small Missouri courtroom with Mike and his family when a judge issued a ruling on his case.\n\n<p />Here's Jessica with more:\n\n<blockquote><p />Following a lawsuit against the Missouri Department of Corrections, Anderson is simply a free man. A judge decided that Mike would receive credit for the entire time that he was accidentally out of prison, thereby satisfying his 13-year sentence. He said he believed Mike to be a \"good man\u201d and jail no longer served a purpose. \n\n<p />Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster also issued this statement: \"From the outset, I have proposed a solution that balances the seriousness of Mr. Anderson's crime with the mistake made by the criminal justice system and Mr. Anderson's lack of a criminal record over the past 13 years. Today's outcome appears to appropriately balance the facts as we understand them.\"\n\n<p />Within minutes of the judge\u2019s ruling, Mike walked out of the courthouse hand in hand with his wife, LaQonna. He told me many times he is incredibly grateful for the support he's received, which includes many listeners who signed a petition requesting his release after his story aired on <em>This American Life</em>.</blockquote>\n\n<p /> A longer report with photos and video of Mike right after his release can be found at <em><a href=\"http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2014/05/cornealious_michael_anderson_i.php\">The Riverfront Times</a></em>, who originally broke the story."

It\u2019s about drug use \u2013 and the various, hopefully surprising things people do while under the influence. As with most of our shows, we\u2019re planning to produce a mix of stories. Some will be on the lighter, funnier side. Others will deal with addiction and the darker aspects of drugs. One or two stories may end up being both funny and dark at turns. \n\n<p />In that mix, we'd like to devote a portion of the show to a collection of shorter stories in the classic \"I was so high...\" genre. So these would be the kind of anecdotes you might hear at a bar or wherever you're hanging out with friends. And we'd like them to come from you. Succinctly put, we're asking you to send us ideas for stories you could tell on the radio about a time when you, or a friend, relative, spouse, parent, co-worker etc., happened to be high and went through something that they'll never forget and maybe even learned something from. We're particularly looking for stories on the lighter/funnier side of the spectrum, though we don't want to rule out a story we like strictly based on the tone. The type of drug doesn't so much matter. It's not a show only about marijuana. Being drunk probably doesn't count. But we'd be open to a good anaesthesia story or two. What we're not looking for is the kind of story that goes, \"I was so high I thought I'd lost my phone, and searched for it for an hour before realizing it was in my pocket.\" In other words, these stories should be like all of your favorite stories on the show: extraordinary, surprising, something people are unlikely to hear anywhere else. Also, importantly, the stories need to be true.\n\n<p />So, if you have a story like that please send it our way. We've set up an email address especially for this purpose: <a href=\"mailto:sohigh@thislife.org\">sohigh@thislife.org</a>. We will not use your name on the air. <strong>Repeated for emphasis: we will NOT use your name on the air.</strong> But please include your full name, email address and phone number so we know that you are an actual person and we can get a hold of you if we want to record you telling your story. Also, please know that we can only devote one or two people to sifting through the emails.  So if you could keep these anecdotes brief &mdash; two or three paragraphs at the most, and less if you can manage it &mdash; that\u2019d be great.\n\n<p />A final note: we just want to stress that we're not trying to condone drug use with this episode, nor trivialize the various impacts that drugs can have on people's lives. We're more just wanting to acknowledge the existence of drug use and the fact that more people have experimented, or have used drugs regularly, than we might expect.   \n\n<p />Thanks so much, everybody. We\u2019re looking forward to hearing what you've got. If we think your story might work for the show, we\u2019ll give you a shout.\n\n<p />Yours sincerely,\n\n <p />The staff of <em>This American Life</em>"

        "description": "<p><img src=\n  \"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/headerdiagram.jpg\" /><br />\n  <em>A diagram from the FBI Laboratory of the room Ibragim Todashev was killed in,\n  released last week as part of a report from Florida State Attorney Jeff Ashton's\n  office.</em></p>\n\n  <p>Last week, after months of investigation, Florida State Attorney Jeffrey\n  Ashton&rsquo;s office released <a href=\"http://sao9documents.net/\">a report</a> on the\n  shooting of Ibragim Todashev. We've been looking forward to this report, hoping\n  it would shed light on some of the mysteries we outlined a few weeks ago in our episode\n  \"<a href=\n  \"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/519/dead-men-tell-no-tales\">Dead\n  Men Tell No Tales</a>\". It does not disappoint. It's impressively thorough, hundreds of\n  pages long, and it answers some of the questions we raised.</p>\n\n  <p>Ibragim, you may remember, was killed by an FBI agent while being questioned at his\n  apartment in Orlando last May. But there was an odd detail to the story: law\n  enforcement officials told reporters that right before the FBI shot him seven times,\n  Ibragim implicated himself in a triple murder. His alleged accomplice for that crime?\n  One of the accused Boston Marathon bombers, long before the Marathon bombing. According\n  to the leaks, Ibragim Todashev was just about to write out a confession when he freaked\n  out, attacked a federal agent, and they had to shoot him to death.</p>\n\n  <p>When we did our episode on all this, the FBI and Massachusetts State Police declined\n  to speak with us, so we were left with lots of questions about what happened the night\n  Ibragim Todashev was shot. And we wondered: was Ibragim truly involved with the triple\n  murder? How much evidence did they have linking him to the crime?</p>\n\n  <p>The Florida State Attorney&rsquo;s Office did not interview the FBI agent who pulled\n  the trigger in Ibragim&rsquo;s apartment, but did question the three other law\n  enforcement officers who were there that night: two Massachusetts state troopers and a\n  member of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Investigators also reviewed photographs,\n  documents, audio and video recordings, text messages, and lots of other material.</p>\n\n  <p>Here are, in our opinion, the most interesting revelations from the State Attorney\n  Officer's investigation:</p>\n\n<p /><strong>Going into the final interview, law enforcement had very little evidence connecting Ibragim to the Waltham triple homicide.</strong> In the Florida report, a Massachusetts trooper who's identified as the lead investigator in the Waltham triple murder case is asked about his initial interest in Ibragim, but the trooper\u2019s answer is redacted. When asked if Ibragim was a suspect in the Waltham triple murder, though, the trooper answers, \"He was a person of interest. Ah, we didn't have anything concrete at that point, that, that tied him into that homicide.\" When the trooper is asked what further evidence developed to increase their interest in Ibragim, the trooper says, \"It was ah, it was more his reluctance to a, a, ah, acknowledge that he was in um, the Boston area in the early, ah, the early week of September. Originally he had put himself outside of ah, outside of Boston area, in August, and [ONE AND A HALF LINES REDACTED] and those are the things that we had wanted to approach him on.\"\n\n<p />Suspicions of Ibragim being a terrorist, which are what brought law enforcement to Ibragim\u2019s door in the first place in the days after the Boston Marathon bombing, are barely mentioned in the report. There are no allegations at all that Ibragim was involved in terrorism.\n\n<p />This helps answer a question we asked at the end of our broadcast: \n\n  <p><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/phonesmall2capt.jpg\"\n  align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 0px 6px\" /><strong>Why didn't they arrest Ibragim that\n  night in his apartment? Did they not have enough evidence for an indictment?</strong>\n  The answer to that is no, they didn't. Again, Ibragim was not officially a suspect at\n  the beginning of the interview. The report includes a text message conversation between\n  one of the state troopers and an unidentified person who appears to be involved in the\n  investigation. At one point, after he was informed that Ibragim had confessed to his\n  role in the Waltham triple murder, that person texted the state trooper: \"Don&rsquo;t\n  put him in custody until we get a warrant.\"</p>\n\n  <p>The Florida report also mentions an assistant district attorney back in\n  Massachusetts who, when he learned around 10:30 PM that Ibragim had implicated himself\n  in the triple murder, says he headed to his office that night to draft an\n  indictment.</p>\n\n  <p>Another big revelation from the report: <strong>There are recordings of the final\n  interview with Ibragim.</strong></p>\n\n  <p>In our story, we reported that there were no recordings from that night, because in\n  all the law enforcement leaks and official statements to the media after the shooting,\n  and in all our conversations with people connected to it, no one had ever alleged that\n  there were. The reason for this, it turns out, is that the FBI itself claims it\n  didn&rsquo;t know there were recordings. The Massachusetts State Police apparently made\n  them on their own, and then didn&rsquo;t tell the FBI about them in initial interviews\n  after the shooting.</p>\n\n  <p>Investigators made one audio and four video recordings of the five-hour interview,\n  captured on three different devices, including a trooper&rsquo;s cell phone and a video\n  recorder that the trooper had to keep deleting his family videos from during the\n  interview in order to make room on the memory card. \"It wasn&rsquo;t a thought out\n  plan...we were moving on the fly,\" the trooper says in the report.</p>\n\n  <p>There is not a recording of Ibragim attacking the FBI agent or the subsequent\n  shooting. When Ibragim began writing his confession, the trooper who was videotaping\n  stopped recording to check the text messages on his phone.</p>\n\n  <p class=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/photo2.jpg\" /><br />\n    <em>Still frames from video recordings taken in Ibragim Todashev's apartment,\n    shortly<br />\n    before he was shot and killed by an FBI agent.</em>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>So, since there are recordings: <strong>What exactly did Ibragim confess\n  to?</strong></p>\n\n  <p>According to an FBI document that&rsquo;s excerpted in the report, during the\n  interview Ibragim claimed he was not involved in the triple murder, but the\n  interrogators kept confronting him about it. Finally, a little before 10:30, Ibragim\n  said, \"Okay, I&rsquo;m telling you I was involved in it, okay, I, I had no idea\n  REDACTION gonna kill anyone.\"</p>\n\n  <p>Here's more from another, largely redacted, FBI document:</p>\n\n  <p class=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/PHOTO3.jpg\" />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>According to the State Attorney Office's report, when Ibragim stated that it was\n  just going to be a robbery, one of the Massachusetts state troopers says he believed\n  they had probable cause to arrest Ibragim. They Mirandized him, but did not arrest him.\n  Instead, they continued to question him for at least another hour. Eventually, one of\n  the officers got Ibragim to agree to write his confession down. At 11:55 PM, one of the\n  state troopers sent a message to the person he was texting with during the\n  interview:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p><strong>Trooper:</strong> \"Whos your daddy\"<br />\n    <strong>Unidentified Person:</strong>\"???\"<br />\n    <strong>Trooper:</strong> \"Getting confession as we speak\"<br />\n    <strong>Unidentified Person:</strong>\"Shut the hell up&hellip;thought that&rsquo;s\n    what u were saying. Who doin interview? Any other suspects?\"<br />\n    <strong>Trooper:</strong> \"Me FBI guy And REDACTED. He [Ibragim]. Is now writing the\n    statement. Gonna be a long night. Still in his apt in Orlando. Admitted his role\"</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>When that last text was sent, at 11:59 PM, Ibragim was sitting across from the FBI\n  agent, writing his confession on this notepad:</p>\n\n  <p class=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/PHOTO5.jpg\" />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>The photo of the notepad in the report is redacted. But our colleagues at <em>Boston\n  Magazine</em> got a hold of what we believe is an unredacted copy of what Ibragim\n  wrote:</p>\n\n  <p class=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/photo6resize.jpg\" />\n  </p>\n\n  <p>As you can see, the photo is blurry and sometimes illegible (see larger version\n  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Photo6.jpg\">here</a>). But\n  here&rsquo;s our best interpretation of what Ibragim wrote:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>My name is IBRAGIM TODASHEV<br />\n    I wanna tell the story about the robbery<br />\n    me and Tam did in Waltham in September<br />\n    of 2011. That was [?] by Tamerlan.<br />\n    [?] [?] he supposed to use to rob<br />\n    the drug dealers. We went to their<br />\n    house we got in there and Tam had<br />\n    a gun he pointed it [?] the guy that<br />\n    opened the door for us [?]<br />\n    we went upstairs into the house<br />\n    [?] 3 guys in there [?] we put them<br />\n    on the ground and then we [?]<br />\n    [?] taped their hands up.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>After he got to that last line, Ibragim knocked over a table, went after the\n  Massachusetts state trooper with a pole, and was shot seven times and killed by the\n  agent.</p>\n\n  <p>But that last line of the written confession caught our eye: <strong>Could Ibragim\n  have made a false confession?</strong></p>\n\n  <p>Ibragim wrote something to effect of: \"we put them on the ground and then we...taped\n  their hands up.\" The Florida state attorney's report points to this line specifically\n  as demonstrating \"the gravity of [Ibragim's] involvement with the crimes being\n  investigated.\"</p>\n\n  <p>But Susan Zalkind, who reported our radio story, spoke last week to the person who\n  first discovered the bodies the three Waltham murder victims, and heard a contradictory\n  account. Susan <a href=\n  \"http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2014/03/27/eyewitness-waltham-crime-scene-didnt-match-description-triple-murder-todashev-confession/\">\n  wrote about it</a> for <em>Boston Magazine</em>:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>...when Hiba Eltilib discovered the bodies of her boyfriend Brendan Mess, 25, Erik\n    Weissman, 31, and Raphael Teken, 37, their hands were not bound or taped, she said\n    Wednesday in a phone call from Sudan. Eltilib said that she found the bodies in three\n    different rooms, all belly-down, in neat pools of blood, heads turned to the\n    side.</p>\n\n    <p>\"None of their hands were tied as I recall,\" she said.</p>\n\n    <p>In an interview Wednesday, Aria Weissman, Erik&rsquo;s sister, said she&rsquo;d\n    never heard mention of any of the victims having their hands taped, either. \"That was\n    the first time hearing anything about it being him tied up, that&rsquo;s really\n    bizarre,\" she said.</p>\n\n    <p>And while the note&rsquo;s claim that \"we put them on the ground\" sounds as if the\n    victims were ordered down at gunpoint, at least two of the victims showed signs of a\n    fight, according to friends who saw the bodies. Weissman had a bloody lip, and Mess\n    had puncture marks on his temple and the top of his head, another mark by his ear,\n    bruises on his face and scratches on his arms.</p>\n\n    <p>The confession mentions a gun, but it doesn&rsquo;t mention the murder weapon.\n    When Eltilib discovered the bodies on September 12, 2011, the victims' throats had\n    been slit with enough force to nearly decapitate them. The note suggests the motive\n    for the crime was a \"robbery,\" even though eight and a half pounds of marijuana and\n    $5,000 in cash was left in the apartment&mdash;and all three of the victims knew\n    Tamerlan. Mess was a close friend.</p>\n\n    <p>...Of course, by all accounts, the confession was incomplete. And because of the\n    difficulty in deciphering the document, it&rsquo;s impossible to say for sure that\n    the note is inconsistent with reports of the crime scene. \"Put them on the ground,\"\n    for example, might have been Todashev&rsquo;s way of describing a physical fight. The\n    note ends abruptly; there was almost certainly more to the story, but Todashev never\n    finished it.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>What should we make of this? If it's true that the victims' hands weren&rsquo;t\n  taped or bound, why would Ibragim write that he'd taped them? If he did actually take\n  part in the crime, it seems like a noteworthy detail to get wrong.</p>\n\n  <p>We called Jim Trainum, to get his take on it. Trainum is a former D.C. police\n  detective who&rsquo;s an expert on false confessions. (We did a <a href=\n  \"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/507/confessions?act=1#play\">story\n  about Trainum and false confessions</a> last fall.) Trainum does not have inside\n  knowledge of Ibragim's case. But he said that in general, in a reliable confession,\n  when someone gives incorrect details it's usually because they're minimizing their role\n  in the crime, not increasing it.</p>\n\n  <p>\"For example,\" he said, \"a guy who kidnapped and murdered a child will admit to\n  those but not to the sexual assault. However, if it were the opposite &mdash; if you\n  had no sexual assault and the person admits sexual assault &mdash; then what&rsquo;s\n  going on there? Why increase their culpability?\"</p>\n\n  <p>Trainum doesn't have enough information on this particular case to determine if\n  Ibragim's confession was valid. But he said adding a detail like that can be a sign of\n  a false confession. It's odd that Ibragim would say he'd helped tape the murder\n  victims' hands if that didn't actually happen.</p>\n\n  <p>Richard Wallsh, the executive director of Florida State Attorney Jeff Ashton&rsquo;s\n  office, told us the chief investigator in charge of looking into Ibragim&rsquo;s\n  shooting did consider the possibility that Ibragim had given a false confession. But\n  Wallsh said that wasn't the focus of their investigation, and the fact that the\n  Massachusetts state troopers felt they had probable cause to arrest Ibragim led the\n  investigator to conclude that the confession was legitimate.</p>\n\n  <p>Members of the State Attorney's Office were also able to watch much of Ibragim's\n  interview on the videos recorded by the state trooper. According to the office&rsquo;s\n  report:</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>At the conclusion of the review, everyone in attendance agreed the manner in which\n    the interviewing officers communicated with Mr. Todashev was not coercive. During\n    this review, we collectively identified how well Mr. Todashev appeared to be walking\n    as he moved about the room&hellip;.The group did not observe any violation of his\n    legal rights.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>It's important to note, though, that \"coercive\" means something different in legal\n  terms than it does in practice. \"Attorneys are looking at coercive tactics for whether\n  or not they make the confession admissible in court,\" Trainum said. \"They&rsquo;re\n  usually not judging it on whether problematic interrogation tactics were used that\n  could&rsquo;ve elicited a false confession.\"</p>\n\n  <p>Clearly the FBI agent and Massachusetts state troopers interviewing Ibragim were\n  satisfied with his confession at the time, because they were getting ready to use it as\n  probable cause to arrest him. And the FBI and Massachusetts investigators are still\n  saying almost nothing about Ibragim's death or the Waltham triple murder case. The FBI\n  released a <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-in-response-to-separate-reports-released-today-by-the-department-of-justice-and-the-florida-state-attorneys-office\">\n  short statement</a> saying they will keep trying to improve agent safety and training.\n  Meanwhile, the Waltham triple murder case remains open.</p>\n\n  <p>\"Identifying all parties responsible for that terrible incident remains a top\n  priority for the Middlesex district attorney's office, the Waltham Police Department,\n  and the Massachusetts State Police,\" the Middlesex district attorney&rsquo;s office in\n  Massachusetts, which has jurisdiction over the Waltham triple murder, said in a\n  statement after the Florida report was released. \"We will not be issuing any further\n  comment at this time.&rsquo;\"</p>\n\n  <p>We believe it&rsquo;s possible that law enforcement is correct about Ibragim&rsquo;s\n  confession, and that he told the truth. But we believe there&rsquo;s also a possibility\n  that Ibragim gave a false or partially false confession. It&rsquo;s possible he was not\n  involved in the triple murder. If that&rsquo;s the case, he was an innocent man who\n  panicked under questioning, gave a false confession, attacked an FBI agent and a\n  Massachusetts state trooper, and was shot to death.</p>\n\n  <p>The Florida state attorney concluded that once Ibragim threw over the table and\n  attacked the officers, they were justified in shooting him in self-defense. Our\n  reporting supports this conclusion. Ibragim was a trained mixed martial arts fighter,\n  and he&rsquo;d been in several fights where he&rsquo;d attacked someone and police were\n  called. The interview took place in a small apartment and it&rsquo;s reasonable that\n  both the FBI agent and the trooper felt that their lives were threatened.</p>"

And yes, you may not have heard of it, but for anyone in radio or TV it's a big big deal. The winners this year include iconic, best-ever shows like <em>Breaking Bad</em>.  \n\n<p />They <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/peabody-awards-recipients-announced-on-ctm/\">announced the winners today live on <em>CBS This Morning</em></a>. One of the judges, Charlayne Hunter-Gault was there. As the host of the ceremony in May, I was there.  \n\n<p />Yesterday I was sent a list of this year's Peabody winners. All of us at <em>This American Life</em> hoped we might get an award for our shows about <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one\">Harper High School</a>. And when I read the list of winners, it was, honestly, a huge disappointment to see that we weren't on it. Everyone here was pretty bummed.  \n\n<p />Then this morning at CBS, I talked to the guy who runs the Peabody Awards as I waited to go on TV. We're making small talk, and he brings up \"Harper High School.\" He tells me how he and the judges loved it, but there were so many great submissions this year, it was so hard to pick winners, blah blah blah. He actually seemed a little nervous having to say this to me and I felt kind of bad for him. We both got very polite with each other. What can you say, really? We hadn't measured up!\n\n<p />Then I go on TV with Charlayne Hunter-Gault and she's reading the winners and the third one she reads is \u2026 Harper High School! I was stunned. Really stunned. In fact, right before she said it, I glanced down at her note cards and saw \"Harper High School\" and almost pointed to it and said \"No no, that's a mistake. We didn't win.\"\n\n<p />Charlie Rose is one of the hosts of <em>CBS This Morning</em> and apparently he didn't know he'd won either. They announced it on the show. Gayle King and Charalyne were the only ones who knew.\n\n<p />So that's how I got punked by the country's oldest and most venerated broadcast award, and by Charalyne Hunter-Gault and Gayle King. Not sure what appropriate payback for this is but y'all are on notice: watch your backs.  \n\n<p />A Peabody special will air on the Pivot TV network. Full list of winners is <a href=\"http://www.peabodyawards.com/stories/story/2013-peabody-winners\">here</a>.\n\n<p />We've also won Peabody Awards for our episodes \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/310/habeas-schmabeas\">Habeas Schmabeas</a>,\" \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money\">The Giant Pool of Money</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/465/what-happened-at-dos-erres\">What Happened at Dos Erres</a>.\" In our first year on the air, 1996, <em>This American Life</em> was given an award for capturing \"contemporary culture in fresh and inventive ways that mirror the diversity and eccentricities of its subjects.\""

        "description": "<p /><strong>Ira writes:</strong>  Our staff gets its big-screen major-studio debut today when the <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/veronicamarsmovie\">Veronica Mars</a></em> movie opens. There's an early scene in what are supposed to be the offices of <em>This American Life</em> and the filmmakers were kind enough to let our actual staff play themselves, as extras wandering around the scene. I have a couple lines. \n\n<p />For those of you who never watched <em>Veronica Mars</em> when it was a TV show, here's what you need to know: it was a film noir, set in high school, then in college.  Like <em>Buffy</em> and <em>The OC</em>, it was funny and great and rose above its own teen genre. Totally worth checking out online if you missed it. \n\n<p />The movie exists thanks to a record-breaking <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project\">Kickstarter campaign</a>, meaning a lot of the money &mdash; over $5 million dollars &mdash; came directly from fans. And no, we didn't get into the film via a monster donation. We\u2019re in the film because when writer/director Rob Thomas tried to figure out where each character would be seven years after the TV show ended, he had one character &mdash; Piz &mdash; who\u2019d been working at a college radio station. Maybe he graduated and got a job at <em>This American Life</em>? \n\n<p />We shot our scene in July in the offices of public radio station <a href=\"http://www.scpr.org/\">KPCC</a>. It's not our real office because the film was shot in Los Angeles. They put up a couple of <em>This American Life</em> posters and a WBEZ logo on the microphone and voil\u00e0.\n\n<p />Here's what I learned about filming a scene with Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell (who plays Piz). At the end of nearly every take, one of them or both would do a little fist-pump thing and go \"Nailed it!\" which was a joke but I have to say was completely contagious. Now in the studio sometimes when I'm doing the radio show, when I finish an intro, the mic goes off and that's what I say.\n\n<p />I love the movie. I know I'm not exactly an objective source about this but it got tons of laughs at the premiere which definitely does not always happen. As a fan of the TV show, I choked up a few times. And two people in our group who'd never seen the TV show both said they were completely entertained. \n\n<p />And now for the geekiest thing we will ever do here on our blog: here's a guide to the real-life <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/about/staff\"><em>This American Life</em> staffers</a> who appear in the film. It's not our whole staff. And yes, I'm very aware that the only people in this world who could possibly be interested in this are superfans of the radio show who ALSO are superfans of <em>Veronica Mars</em>. If that's a Venn diagram that does not include you, no hard feelings. Pictures of us on the set and at the New York premiere with the cast are below.  \n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/alissa_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/AdrianneNancy_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/JonathanNancy_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Lisa_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Brian_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Emily_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/JonathanElise_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Phia_sm.jpg\">\n\n<p />Phia &mdash; who was our intern at the time (and now works at <em><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/\">Planet Money</a></em>) &mdash; is actually in a shot where you can see her suddenly realizing she's not standing on her mark. She steps backward, to the spot she's supposed to be. Yes, this is what happens when you invite complete amateurs into your film. \n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Phia_Labeled.gif\">\n\n<p />Chris Lowell who plays Piz also likes to <a href=\"http://www.chrislowellphotography.com/\">take photographs</a>, and he took a bunch of black and whites the day we were there.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Piz13.jpg\"><br />\n<em>Me and Kristen Bell.</em>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Piz11.jpg\"><br />\n<em>Brian Reed, Jonathan Goldstein, and Emily Condon.</em>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Piz4.jpg\"><br />\n<em>Brian Reed and Lisa Pollak.</em>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Piz3.jpg\"><br />\n<em>Nancy Updike, who'd just flown in from overseas.</em>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Piz15.jpg\">\nThis American Life <em>staff with Kristen Bell.</em>\n\n<p />James Franco was on set the day we were there. Incredibly, he knew who we were. I'd just seen <em>This is the End</em> and told him how much I'd liked him in it, and he pointed out that he was acting, that that wasn't really him, which I knew but it made me feel bad for all the dumbass things people must say all the time to James Franco. That's Rob Thomas, the film's writer and director, in the middle. Photo by Adrianne Mathiowetz.\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/franco.jpg\"><br />\n\n<p />This next set of shots was taken at the New York premiere on Monday night.  The party afterwards was a deeply endearing scene: hundreds of marshmallows who'd donated money to the film on Kickstarter got a chance to hang out with the stars of the TV show they loved and everyone was so surprisingly cool and nice.  I met people who flew in from Washington State and Wisconsin and Qatar.  Kristen Bell and Rob Thomas and the others were just amazingly sweet, joking around and talking and taking pictures with everyone who wanted to talk to them.  It reminded me of a public radio reception, except with free booze and movie stars.  \n\n<p />\nPhotos by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BoothPhotoVideo\">The Booth Photo & Video</a>:\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0139.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0145.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0156.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0170.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0584.jpg\">\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/VM_0501_2.jpg\">"

        "description": "<p />Earlier this year in our \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle\">Stuck in the Middle</a>\" show, we ran a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle?act=2\">story</a> about women in the Orthodox Jewish community whose husbands refuse to give them a Jewish writ of divorce, called a \"get\" in Hebrew. Since that story aired, there's been an update on one person featured in the story. \n\n<p />Here's reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markopp1\">Mark Oppenheimer</a> with more:\n\n<p />My story featured a woman named Gital Dodelson, a law student and mother of a young son who has been waiting several years for her get. And on the morning of Feb. 5, an e-mail arrived in my in box, from somebody deep in the know. \u201cGital just got her get,\u201d it read.\n\n<p />And indeed she had. Based on some follow-up reporting I have done \u2014 with people who refused to be named \u2014 I learned that Gital had to agree to certain slight amendments to the custody arrangement for her son. She also had to pay her ex-husband a lump sum in the low six figures. Rabbinic authorities generally agree that a woman should not have to pay money for a get, although people on the husband\u2019s side said that the money didn\u2019t begin to cover his legal expenses. Of course, Gital had legal expenses, too.\n\n<p />Meanwhile, there are many more Gitals. Two years ago, Barbara Zakheim, a Jewish women\u2019s advocate in Washington, D.C., released the results of a census she had performed of agunot, or chained wives \u2014 women whose husbands won\u2019t grant them divorces. She counted 462 such women in North America, a number that is surely low."

We've been trying a lot of ambitious stories here on the radio show. And we've cut down on fundraising so that we only come to you one week per year to ask for <a href=\"https://www.chicagopublicmedia.org/give/support-american-life\">donations</a>. This is that week!\n\n<p />This past year it cost us $137,000 just for the bandwidth to get our show out to you and everyone else who listens over the Internet. We rely on donations to cover that cost, and to help pay for producing the actual stories &mdash; like the episode where we sent seven reporters to a car dealership over the course of a month, or when we sent three reporters to Harper High School for five months, or Sarah Koenig's investigation of the murder committed by Dr. Vince Gilmer. As you can imagine, that kind of reporting is very expensive. \n\n<p />You've probably heard about how this is a difficult time for journalism, newspapers laying people off and shutting down, and dwindling budgets for investigative reporting. And the great thing about putting stuff out over the Internet, like our podcast, is that if you like it and want it to continue, you can help that happen. But for this to work, for us to ask for money only once per year... you actually have to give. As in,  I'm not writing this to someone else &mdash; I'm writing to you, a person who listens to our show for free over the Internet. So if you like what we've been doing on the show and want us to be able to keep making it, please consider <a href=\"https://www.chicagopublicmedia.org/give/support-american-life\">donating</a>. \n\n<p />Thank you. We can't produce the show without your help and we really appreciate it.\n<p /> &mdash; Ira"

We collaborated with them on <a href=\"http://g.co/doodle/bvuf9y\">today\u2019s page</a>. It features love stories, produced by our show, with animations created by Google artists. \n\n<p />There\u2019s a whole team of people who make these homepage graphics at Google, which are called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles\">Google Doodles</a>. I think my favorite moment working with them came during an early conference call. We were talking about how we needed music to put under the voices. Should we commission original pieces for this or just license music that\u2019s out there already? \n\n<p />Of course, to license music, you need to estimate how many people will hear it. The more people, the more you pay.\n\n<p />\u201cHow many people will come to the Google homepage that day?\u201d I asked.\n\n<p />\u201cThat would be a zillion,\u201d someone said. \u201cThat\u2019s the number we like to use.\u201d\n\n<p />They were joking about how many zeroes are in that figure but you get the point. Licensing wasn\u2019t an option.\n\n<p />Later I was talking with the composer we found, Roger Neill, about the assignment. Roger does scores for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002685/\">movies and TV shows</a> including one of my favorite film scores, for the movie <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXUFUp6vsxg\"><em>Beginners</em></a>. Sometimes we use this insanely great <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqb2db0f_3A&list=RDYXZB_7zKfoA&index=2\">piano piece</a> from that soundtrack on our radio show.\n\n<p />Anyway, Roger and I were talking about how we\u2019d better do a good job on this, because more people would see these little love stories than anything we\u2019d ever do in our regular work lives. Bigger than being on the radio. Bigger than movies and TV.\n\n<p />I\u2019ve been a fan of Google Doodles for a while (though I only recently learned they had a name and that name is Google Doodles). I liked that they seemed able to do anything on their homepage &mdash; a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/logos/2013/crossword/crossword13.html\">crossword puzzle</a>, a <em><a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/doctor-whos-50th-anniversary\">Dr. Who</em> video game</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/saul-bass-93rd-birthday\">tribute to Saul Bass</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/les-pauls-96th-birthday\">Les Paul guitar</a> or a fully functioning <a href=\"http://www.google.com/doodles/robert-moogs-78th-birthday\">Moog Synthesizer</a> (with its own four-track tape recorder). It\u2019s interesting that in this big global company, with millions or maybe it\u2019s billions of dollars in computer servers everywhere, and all this tech and engineering, they have people doing something for their biggest product \u2013 their search engine \u2013 that\u2019s so... handmade. And idiosyncratic. This Doodle is their first foray into documentary storytelling and I hope they do more stuff like it. I hope they reach out to Wes Anderson and Laurie Anderson and Anderson Cooper and artists whose names are not Anderson as future collaborators.\n\n<p />We made seven mini-love stories for the Google team but because there are only six letters in Google, one had to be cut. It\u2019s pretty great though, a little fable about love, and it\u2019s <a href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/TAL_lovetest.mp3\">here</a>. Three of the love stories have appeared on our radio show, in much longer forms. Puppy Love was part of a much <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/449/middle-school?act=2#play\">bigger story</a> about middle school dances, in an <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/449/middle-school\">episode</a> about Middle School; Crush is the opening of our episode <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/152/crush?act=0#play\">of the same name</a>; and Kiss is from <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/128/four-corners?act=2#play\">Four Corners</a>, which aired 15 years ago. That\u2019s comedian Mike Birbiglia doing the interview in Blind Date, part of a story he\u2019s putting together for an upcoming episode. The last two interviews were done by Miki Meek, one of our producers here at the radio show, who was my partner in making the audio for these love stories.\n\n<p />Miki and I didn\u2019t see any of the animations till this week and we both think the animators did a spectacular job. Before they began, the only general guideline we all thought would be smart was that the artists shouldn\u2019t just illustrate what the people were saying. The images wouldn\u2019t add enough to the experience if they were literally just showing what the interviewers were describing. (This is something cartoonist Chris Ware was concerned with when he made <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbVeN13wGFc\">animated cartoons</a> of <em>This American Life</em> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxQ9Gx2-ceM\">stories</a> for us, years ago.) I love what the Doodle staff came up with. The non-literalness is what makes them great. Some of the animations are like comic riffs on what\u2019s being said. The people appear as dogs or hearts. And when the stories get sad, they nail that too. \n\n<p />The Google Doodle team talked about about their experiences working with us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o59sAakI28o\">here</a>.\n\n<p />One weird thing about creating audio for the Internet is that making it sound good coming out of a laptop\u2019s or desktop\u2019s speakers is an art in and of itself \u2013 and very different than mixing for car radio or podcast. Honestly we had no idea how to do it, so I was grateful for Jeff Seelye from <a href=\"http://www.digitaudio.com/\">Dig It Audio</a> to take that over.\n\n<p />This Valentine\u2019s Day project happened because I was in San Francisco in November, and got a tour of Google\u2019s headquarters, and met with the Doodle team. They reminded me of the radio show\u2019s staff, the general vibe of the group, and the sense that they\u2019re out to amuse themselves and make whatever will be fun or moving. I think our staff size is about the same too, roughly a dozen people. It\u2019s a weird and idealistic corner in a weird and idealistic company. There was a general sort of \u201chey wouldn\u2019t it be fun to try to collaborate on something together?\u201d They pitched July 4th as a good possibility. We counter-pitched Valentine\u2019s Day, because the stories could be more emotional. That kind of freaked them out, to have to turn so many little animations around so quickly. They weren\u2019t sure it could be done. Now three months later, here we are. Incredible. Valentine\u2019s Day is a day for love and these stories are a labor of love.\n\n<p />- Ira\n\n<p />PS: We built another <a href=\"http://valentine.thisamericanlife.org\">special page</a> that collects more loves stories."

The first was <em>Seven Up!</em> The latest is <em>56 Up</em>.  \n\n<p />But until this year, I don\u2019t think anyone ever attempted this on the radio.  Then our colleagues at Radio Diaries returned to a group of teenagers they\u2019d originally handed tape recorders to 16 years ago and did a fascinating series of stories that aired on <em>All Things Considered</em>.  Each kid was now roughly twice the age they were the first time around and of course not a kid at all anymore.  <a href=\"http://www.radiodiaries.org/melissa-16-years-later/\">Melissa</a> who\u2019d been in foster care now had two kids of her own.  <a href=\"http://www.radiodiaries.org/josh-16-years-later/\">Josh</a> who struggled with Tourette\u2019s had become a school teacher!  Didn\u2019t see that coming!  The radio stories they made about their own lives are as different from the Apted series as radio is from film.  More intimate.  And of course much more from their point of view.  They have a beautiful <a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/teenage-diaries/\">webpage</a> with all the stories, and a Radio Diaries <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/npr-radio-diaries-podcast/id207505466?mt=2\">podcast</a>.\n\n<p />I mention all this because Joe Richman, who created the series, is coming to DC this coming Tuesday to do an event with Josh and Melissa.  <em>All Things Considered</em>\u2019s Melissa Block is co-hosting.  It\u2019s a rare look at the making of some very unusual, very special first-person reporting.  They show pictures and tell stories and Joe\u2019s a real sweetheart.  You can see why people open up to him and say such revealing things in his documentaries when you watch him talk and joke around with the diarists onstage.  \n\n<p />They still have some <a href=\"http://www.sixthandi.org/event/teenage-diaries-revisited/\">tickets</a> but you should act fast.  Seriously.\n<br>Tuesday November 12th - 7PM\n<br>Historic Sixth and I Street Synagogue and Performance Space\n\n<p />\n<hr>\n<em>2013 Photo by David Gilkey/NPR. 1996 photo by Radio Diaries.</em>"

        "description": "<p />Ira writes:  \n\n<p />Okay, this is the most random thing that\u2019s happened to me in a long time.  I was asked to dance in Yoko Ono\u2019s new music video.  Who says no to that?  Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like:  a car service picks you up and takes you to a nondescript building that\u2019s set up for a video shoot.  Lots of youngish people plus Yoko Ono.  Oh hello there most famous person I\u2019ve ever met!  She\u2019s gracious, has to be reminded by a handler who in the world I am.  Then totally acts nice, says something along the lines of \u201cI appreciate the work you do\u201d which either means she\u2019s heard my work or she hasn\u2019t.  Who cares!  She\u2019s Yoko Ono!  And it\u2019s inherently weird, right?  For her too.  She\u2019s a lovely, not-terribly tall older woman in really beautiful clothes.  \n\n<p />Each performer is called up, one at a time.  First they play the song and you dance to it alone.  The song is called \u201cbad dancer\u201d so I\u2019m the perfect participant because - though I love to dance, I have no illusions.  I\u2019m a spaz.  I stand in front of the camera and 20 handlers and hipsters and publicists and crew and Yoko Ono and I think a reporter from Rolling Stone and I tell myself to pretend I can do this and I dance.  Then we do a take where I dance with Yoko which they use none of in the video.  When the camera starts rolling, Yoko reminds me of other performance artists I\u2019ve known: she\u2019s assured, she\u2019s game to try stuff, she\u2019s a good improviser.  We do a slow motion sidestep towards each other and then circle each other.  We do a thing where she dances while I gesture towards her like \u2018you are the bomb.\u2019  If I knew how to dance I\u2019m sure I could\u2019ve come up with better stuff.   The song seems to last a very long time, as we circle each other and improv this and that.  I wonder if it\u2019s okay to take her hand or touch her in any way.  Somehow, I\u2019m not up to that.  I don\u2019t try.  I\u2019m a guest here in her world.  If handholding or touching is supposed to happen between you and Yoko Ono or you and the Queen of England, they are the ones who initiate it.\n\n<p /><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/d3mvEfON2CI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

He's the unusually-young-for-a-guy-premiering-his-work-at-the-Met composer of the new opera Two Boys. I really like his music and am so incredibly curious to see how he turns a real incident \u2013 about a 16-year-old boy who almost murdered another boy \u2013 and the Internet chats that lead to the attack \u2013 into an opera.  \n\n<p />Our interview is at the NY Public Library next Tuesday, Oct 29th, 7:00. <a href=\"http://nypl.org/live\">Tickets</a>.  \n\n<p />There's a video excerpt from the opera on the <a href=\"http://www.metoperafamily.org/video/2013-2014/watch/met-premiere-two-boys/2758838361001?utm_source=TwoBoysOpen2&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=1314_SS&utm_content=vid\n\">Metropolitan Opera site</a>. They also commissioned this <a href=\"http://www.whatisthesoundoftheinternet.com\">arty but beautiful video</a> in conjunction with the opera, hoping, I'm told, that people who aren't into classical music or opera might like it."

The Dos Erres massacre was the subject of an episode we aired last year, called <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/465/what-happened-at-dos-erres\">What Happened At Dos Erres</a>, about a Guatemalan immigrant named Oscar Ramirez Casta&ntilde;eda who discovered, after decades of not knowing, that he had been at the massacre as a young child and had lost most of his family there. In the decade since the massacre, the lieutenant, Jorge Vinicio Sosa Orantes, has lived between the United States and Canada, and for a while operated several karate schools in Southern California. He was found guilty of lying to the U.S. government about his involvement in the massacre when he applied for citizenship. Oscar traveled to California from his home in Massachusetts to be at the trial.\n\n<p />\nSosa is now the eighth soldier who was involved in the Dos Erres massacre to be convicted in either Guatemala or the U.S. Seven soldiers remain at large.\n \n<p />\nOne of the reporters of our story, Sebastian Rotella, has been following the Sosa trial for ProPublica. You can read more about <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/they-ordered-us-to-kill-all-the-people\">the trial and testimony</a> and also <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/ex-guatemalan-commando-guilty-of-concealing-role-in-massacre\">the conviction</a> at their web site. \n<p />\n<em>Pictured: Jorge Vinicio Sosa Orantes as a young soldier.

In fact, the email was written by a Georgia Tech alum who now works in admissions at a university in South Carolina. If you heard Rick's interview, you'll see: he's a very careful listener!  \n\n<p /><hr><br />\n\n<p />Dear Director of Admissions Rick Clark,\n \n<p />My son George Jr. fell in love with GT when we were on campus during the Elon game (what a blowout!) and has now decided to attend Georgia Tech. I am worried that he just turned 7 and we are running out of time on his college search, hence the serious urgency of this email. Can you help me arrange a campus tour for him? He would also like to sit in on a class, meet with current students, visit with faculty, the dean, an admission counselor, yourself, and especially president Peterson. We can be there tomorrow afternoon, assuming everyone is available, so we can seal the deal.\n \n<p />Also, I am happy to fax to you his first grade transcript so you can give me a quick read on his admissibility. Unfortunately his Montessori elementary school does not give letter grades, but he got all \"checks\", so in that sense he is #1 in his class although they don\u2019t really rank in the first grade. I\u2019m sure his teacher\u2019s comments will confirm his grit, determination, academic potential, and commitment to global awareness, diversity, and service. He also gets along with everyone during recess and does not disturb people during nap time. \n \n<p />Either my wife or I will call or write you every day just to check in with you to make sure everything is on track and so that you will know that USC is his #1 choice, no exceptions. You probably know I am a Georgia Tech alumnus, as is my wife, her two sisters, and both their husbands. We are a Tech family and we bleed gold and white! Our boy is a huge fan of your school and cannot imagine going anywhere else since it is our family\u2019s school. He is a legacy so I\u2019m hoping that will make a difference. Imagine how proud we all will be when he carries on the family tradition! He intends to join the Ramblin' Wreck club so he can drive the Model A out on the field. Should he include that in his admission essay?\n \n<p />Although, I do have to say I am disappointed that George Jr. has not received very much mail from Georgia Tech so far. I am worried that you are not actively recruiting him and what that means. Have we not shown enough demonstrated interest? Do you think he isn\u2019t academically competitive? Have we committed some faux pas? Please don't hold our mistakes against him; as we are new to this admissions game. I assure you he is very smart and I know would be a good fit for [enter school name here]. I just don\u2019t know if he is a good test-taker or not because he hasn\u2019t taken any yet, but will send you his PPPPPSAT scores when available.\n \n<p />George would like to write something to you.  He doesn\u2019t have his own email account yet, so I am letting him write the next section:\n \n<p />Hello Sir my name is George Burdell. My mom calls me Georgie but I prefer George. I think Georgia Tech is awesome and cool. I would like to go there like my mom and dad. Do you think I will get in? Please admit me so I don't have to go to that school with the red colors. I have a cool hat with GT on it and a cool shirt with Buzz on it. Our dog is named Buzz. He\u2019s a schnauzer and can do tricks like roll over and fist bump. I am very good at MineCraft and Legos so maybe I will be an architect. That would be awesome. \n <br />&mdash;George Burdell, Jr.\n \n<p />Thanks, Rick, for your time. Please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve George\u2019s chances for admission, and I look forward to hearing from you within seconds after I send you this email.\n \n<p />Sincerely,\n<br />George P. Burdell\n<br />Class of 1990\n \n<p />p.s.  We hope your staff enjoyed the cookies we sent!\n<br />p.p.s   Did you see my friend request? Didn\u2019t see where it's been accepted yet, so just wondering\u2026\n \n <p />(All names have been changed. Any similarities to actual persons living or dead are purely coincidental.)"

Chicago Police and the medical examiner\u2019s office say he\u2019d been killed by a gunshot wound to the head. He was 17.\n\n<p />His death was ruled a homicide, and police say they\u2019re actively investigating it, though nobody\u2019s been charged.\n\n<p />Staff who we talked to at Harper said Green didn\u2019t have a reputation for getting into trouble, and mostly described him as a quiet kid.\n\n<p />We are so very sad to hear about his death, and to hear that the students, staff and families of Harper are once again carrying the burdens of the violence around them.  Our thoughts go out to Darryl Green\u2019s family, friends and to everyone at Harper."

It\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s consensus about certain episodes across various lists, even old ones like this <a href=\"http://www.avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/our-favorite-this-american-life-moments,73810/\">Onion AV Club</a> list or <a href=\"http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/05/six-must-listen-this-american-life-episodes.html\">Paste magazine\u2019s list</a> or on this <a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/20670/This-American-Life\">Metafilter discussion</a>.\n\n<p />You may not know that we have several favorites pages at our own website, including a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/favorites\">short list</a> for people who\u2019ve never heard us before.  Then because we couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone, we made a list of <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/favorites/other-favorites\">other favorites</a> with, like, 60 other shows.  Then a list of <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/favorites/early-shows\">early shows</a> from our first two years on the air.  Yes, we\u2019ve shown lots of discipline in picking favorites.  \n\n<p />We do hope that the lists are helpful for people looking for a good show to listen to.\n\n<p />The favorites on the 500th episode were staff picks.  And there were lots of shows and stories we were sorry not to include in the 500th episode.  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/175/babysitting?act=3\">The McCrearies story</a> from the Babysitting show, which is probably \u2013 because the interviewee was so great \u2013 the best interview I\u2019ve ever done.  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/82/haunted?act=3\">David Sedaris\u2019s story about his mom dying</a>, from episode 82.  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/199/house-on-loon-lake\">The House on Loon Lake</a>.  Shalom Auslander\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/281/my-big-break?act=3\">The Blessing Bee</a>. Alix Spiegel\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/204/81-words\">81 Words</a> or her <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/317/unconditional-love?act=1\">story about the couple adopting the boy from Romania</a>.  Scott Carrier\u2019s episode <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/181/the-friendly-man\">The Friendly Man</a>.  The <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/281/my-big-break?act=1\">Ed Sullivan story</a> in My Big Break.  <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/172/24-hours-at-the-golden-apple\">The Golden Apple show</a>.  The <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/tv-archives/season-two/john-smith\">John Smith episode</a> of our TV show.  Picking things for the 500th episode was hard partly because a lot of the best stories \u2013 like the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/360/switched-at-birth\">Switched at Birth</a> show or the McCrearies \u2013 don\u2019t excerpt well.  I\u2019m glad we won\u2019t have to pick again for a very long time.\n\n<p />- Ira\n\n<p /><br><em>photo by Adrianne Mathiowetz</em>"

The article is by Joel Lovell, a good friend of David and also a contributor to our show. Joel quotes Ira Glass saying of David's book:\n\n<p />\"Its dirty little secret is that David was probably a better novelist than he was an essayist. I mean, he was a great essayist, famous and all that, but that came so hard to him, and I think writing this, writing drama, gave him so much more pleasure.\"\n\n<p />Before David died, Ira recorded David reading the audio book version. Excerpts from the recording session accompany the article, as well as a photo of David's last performance on our show, the story and dance he did for our live event in May 2012."

We filmed it with seven cameras and sent it live into movie theaters.  You can <a href=\"http://bit.ly/REe0Lr\">download or stream the video</a> directly from our site, for five bucks.\n\n<p />It features all sorts of things that are way to visual to be on the radio: dance, animation, illustration, an interactive musical performance, photographs, a short film, and David Sedaris in clown makeup. Along with Sedaris, there are stories by the now-famous Tig Notaro, Glynn Washington, Ryan Knighton and David Rakoff. Lots of the stories are funny. David Rakoff's is particularly touching. He talks about the abilities he lost during his fight with cancer, and then, gracefully, beautifully, does a solo dance onstage. It was the last story Rakoff ever wrote for the radio show. He died three months later, in August, 2012. A bit of his dance is included in the trailer above.\n\n<p />OK Go provides music. Monica Bill Barnes & Company dance. Ira Glass tells a story using things he normally can't: photos. Mike Birbiglia casts Terry Gross in a surprising, hilarious little movie. \n\n<p />We're incredibly proud of this show and excited that more people can <a href=\"http://bit.ly/REe0Lr\">see it for just a few dollars</a>. It's also available on <a href=\"https://store.thisamericanlife.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=INVISIBLE-MADE-VISIBLE-DVD\">DVD</a>, for all you object fetishists and gift givers. Though you can actually gift the download, too.\n\n<p />Have fun.\n\n<p />- Your friends at <em>This American Life</em>"

        "description": "<p />Hello Listeners!\n\n<p />We're once again gearing up for a \"This Week\" show, where we tackle the week's news in our own way, far from the TV cameras and the standard headlines. We'll cover stories very big and very small. The big ones will be more topical, and therefore easier for us to find. But for the smaller ones, we need your help. We've done two of these shows already, and your ideas and pitches have been critical to making the whole thing work. We figure the best way to thank you for that, is to just keep on taking (we pay!). So we're appealing to you again. \n\n<p />Here's what we\u2019re looking for: Things that are happening to you, or to someone you know, or just out in the world, from June 8 - 14. These can be personal things &mdash; a first date, a divorce becoming final, opening a new business, a crucial baseball game. We'd especially like local news stories from your neck of the woods that aren't getting national coverage, but still tell us a lot about what it's like to live where you live. Or one that\u2019s just absurd &mdash; the kind that\u2019s a sheer pleasure to tell other people. Or just any interesting situation coming to a head that week &mdash; at school, at work, at city council, at your family reunion &mdash; where things will be decided, lines drawn, sides taken. That would be perfect, too. But again &mdash; no idea is too small.  \n\n<p />Here\u2019s the other thing we\u2019d like: If something\u2019s happening to you that week, please tape it yourself. On your phone, or your camera &mdash; the quality doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, as long as it\u2019s audible. If it\u2019s too big to email to us, we can talk you through how to send it another way. \n\n<p />Please email your ideas and pitches to <a href=\"mailto:thisweek@thislife.org\">thisweek@thislife.org</a>. \n\n<p />And again, thank you so much, in advance, for all your great help. We can't pull off this show without you. \n\n<p />&mdash; Your friends at <em>This American Life</em>"

Some of the stories in this show began as <em>This American Life</em> pieces, but over the last 18 months, Birbigs has rewritten and remade a lot of the show.  I saw it in its first run in New York and am dying of curiosity to see the changes he's put in place.  About a fourth of the show is new and what that means is not just that Mike swapped out better punchlines here and there; he re-engineered some of the storytelling and structure.  As a result, I'm told, the show's now more emotional and more affecting.  And yes, funnier, which isn't easy because it got huge laughs in its original version.  I and the Monica Bill Barnes Dance Company are the opening act, doing one of the stories from our new show where I tell stories and they dance.  We played Carnegie Hall once before, and brought down the house - a review is <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/02/philip-glass-ira-glass-tibetan-dancers\">here</a> - and we hope to do it again.\n\n<p />It'll be a really fun night.

One has to die for another to join.  It's been around since 1898.

        "description": "<p />Sarah Koenig here. After our show \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/492/dr-gilmer-and-mr-hyde\">Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde</a>\" aired, we got some emails about the way I discussed Huntington's Disease in the story. Just to remind you: The story was about a beloved family doctor, Vince Gilmer, who brutally killed his own father. By the end of the story &mdash; spoiler coming now &mdash; we figure out that Vince has Huntington's Disease, a genetic disorder that can cause physical and psychological symptoms.  \n\n<p />The emails pointed out that a listener could walk away from the story believing that Huntington\u2019s Disease led to Vince Gilmer\u2019s violent behavior &mdash; that it contributed to the murder. We did not intend to draw that connection. Because I can't say for certain how, or if, Huntington's was affecting Vince at the time.\n\n<p />Michelle Meyer, a fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, wrote to us: \n\"Although the occasional incidents involving people with HD [Huntington\u2019s Disease] who kill themselves or others make for splashy news and riveting human interest stories, the fact is that the vast majority of people with HD are not dangerous to themselves or others.\"\n\n<p />It\u2019s a sensitive topic, listeners pointed out, because of the history of discrimination against people with the disease. Meyer continued: \n\n<p />\"People with HD are instead much more likely to be the victims of violence. They were burned at the stake as witches in Salem and sent to the gas chambers during the Holocaust, for instance. Less dramatically, they are routinely turned away from public accommodations or arrested because their chorea is mistaken for drunkenness. Many who are at risk for HD choose not to be tested, not only because they don't want to know, but also, in many cases, because they fear the consequences of an HD diagnosis for their employment and insurance status \u2026 on top of the risk that others will respond to them with irrational fears and prejudices.\"\n\n<p />So to repeat: I did not mean to imply that Huntington's is what made Vince do this violent thing. Or to imply that he\u2019s not responsible for what he did, because of Huntington's. I regret that I didn't make that clearer in the story. If we rebroadcast the story, we'll correct that."

Eugenie Mukeshimana is a survivor of the Rwandan genocide; Thomas Buergenthal was in Auschwitz as a boy; with a remarkable lack of bitterness about the past, he went on to become a judge at the International Criminal Court of Justice in The Hague.

Habiba Nosheen reported the story. Brian Reed produced it.\n\n<p />From the award announcement: \"The judges were riveted as they listened to this compelling and beautifully narrated story of recent events and the violent massacre of more than 200 people in the village of Dos Erres in Guatamala more than two decades ago. In 2012 the discovery of a father, still alive, and his son Oscar Ramirez, an undocumented worker in the U.S., each of whom assumed the other dead in the tragedy, prompted reporter Nosheen and producer Reed to devote five months to researching the story, finding victims and perpetrators. As a result, Ramirez was granted political asylum in the U.S. and several implicated soldiers have been apprehended for trial.\" \n\n<p />Previously, \"What Happened at Dos Erres\" won the <a href=\"http://peabodyawards.com/2013/03/72nd-annual-peabody-awards-complete-list-of-winners/\">Peabody Award</a>, the <a href=\"http://dartcenter.org/content/what-happened-at-dos-erres-finding-oscar#.UXgInYJAu08\">Dart Award</a>, and the Silver Award at the <a href=\"http://thirdcoastfestival.org/library/1217-what-happened-at-dos-erres\">Third Coast International Audio Festival</a>. \n\n<p /><em>Image: Oscar Ram&iacute;rez Casta&ntilde;eda, photographed by Matthew Healey for ProPublica</em>"

Any additional donations will help us produce stories. Thank you to everyone who donated! \n\n<p /><strong>Ira Glass writes:</strong>\n\n<p />Hi everyone.  If you listen to our podcast or stream shows here on the website, you are costing us a bit of money.  So many people stream and download our program that it cost our home radio radio station WBEZ Chicago $170,000 dollars this past year for the Internet bandwidth to deliver the program.  I know that number is insane. And that\u2019s just bandwidth, not servers or personnel or any other costs. \n\n<p />If you donate just $5 or $10, it more than covers the cost of getting the show to you online. Plus we use these donations to fund especially expensive projects, like when we sent three reporters to Harper High School this Fall, on and off over five months. Expensive!  Or when we sent reporters to Guatemala for that story last May about the guy who discovered that the man he thought was his father actually was one of the commanders of an army unit that killed most of his family and his entire village back in the 1980s. \n\n<p />Your donation does NOT cover the cost of having Fred Armisen come in and imitate me hosting our show. That cost like, nothing.  When we needed to go through 1700 coincidence stories you sent in for the episode \u201cNo Coincidence, No Story\u201d \u2013 also surprisingly cheap!\n\n<p />I used to go on the podcast and website several weeks each year and ask for donations. You might have noticed that we haven't done it since 2011, a year and a half ago. If this campaign goes well, it'll be just this week. \n\n<p />I hope you\u2019ll consider <a href=\"https://www.chicagopublicmedia.org/give/support-american-life\">donating</a>.  We\u2019ll put the money to good use.  And thanks.\n\n<p />&mdash; Ira"

It has a completely ridiculous premise: radio stories... plus dance. The dance part is done by Monica Bill Barnes & Company. They\u2019re the incredible dancers we had in our <a href=\"http://live.thisamericanlife.org/\">live cinema show</a> last May. I suppose you can figure out who does the radio stories part of the show.\n\n<p />The show\u2019s a mix of two things that really have no business being on stage together at all. Dance is all visuals, no talking. Radio\u2019s all talking, no visuals. But what the stories on our show have in common with dance is music. That\u2019s a start. And Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass are such funny, human-scale, relatable sorts of performers; their sensibility somehow matches a lot of what we do on the radio show. \n\n<p />I know this whole thing sounds a little nuts but I swear it\u2019s pretty great. Huge laughs. Big emotions. The one time we\u2019ve tried this on stage was a ten-minute excerpt at Carnegie Hall and it brought down the house. <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/02/philip-glass-ira-glass-tibetan-dancers\">Seriously</a>.\n\n<p />The Philadelphia shows are on Saturday, April 20th and Sunday, April 21st. We\u2019ve priced tickets on the cheap side \u2013 they start at $20. I really really hope you come out. \n\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.annenbergcenter.org/tickets/?id=290\">TICKETS</a>\n\n<p /><a href=\"http://oneradiohosttwodancers.com/home/\">SHOW SITE</a>"

The rise has come even as medical advances have allowed many more people to remain on the job and new laws have banned workplace discrimination against the disabled. Every month, 14 million people now get a disability check from the government.\n\n<p />The federal government spends more money each year on cash payments for disabled former workers than it spends on food stamps and welfare combined. Yet people relying on disability payments are often overlooked in discussions of the social safety net. People on federal disability do not work. Yet, because they are not technically part of the labor force, they are not counted among the unemployed.\n\n<p />In other words, people on disability don't show up in any of the places we usually look to see how the economy is doing. But the story of these programs &mdash; who goes on them, and why, and what happens after that &mdash; is, to a large extent, the story of the U.S. economy. It's the story not only of an aging workforce, but also of a hidden, increasingly expensive safety net.\n\n<p />For the last six months, I've been reporting on the growth of federal disability programs. I've been trying to understand what disability means for American workers, and, more broadly, what it means for poor people in America nearly 20 years after we ended welfare as we knew it. \n\n<p /><strong>Chana's story - including video, startling graphs, and photos of interviewees &mdash; continues on the <a href=\"http://npr.org/disability\">Planet Money website</a>.</strong>"

I remember sitting in one of NPR's old first-floor studios on M Street in Washington, listening to Joe as he recorded a monologue, feeling all caught up in everything he was saying, wondering what would happen next in the story, transported in a way I'd never felt before listening to the radio.  I wondered how he did it.  I wanted to do it myself.  Of course I'd listened to lots of radio before that, but I'd never heard anyone tell a story on the air that was actually truly can't-turn-away think-about-it-for-days-after compelling. \n\n<p/>One of our former producers, Jonathan Goldstein, just did a <a href=\"http://www.believermag.com/issues/201303/?read=interview_frank\">great interview with Joe in <em>The Believer</em></a>.  Jonathan's show <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap/\"><em>WireTap</em></a>  is unmistakably influenced by Joe's work.  He understands Joe's approach at a cellular level.  So it was amazing &mdash; for me, anyway &mdash; to read what happened when they actually spoke to each other.  I'm so interested to know if Joe has ever heard <em>WireTap</em>, but they don't get into that.  \n\n<p/>If you don't know either show, I recommend them both.  A great Joe Frank episode to start with is the one Jonathan mentions in <em>The Believer</em>, \"<a href=\"http://joefrank.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=230\">The Eighty Yard Run</a>.\" Yes, Joe asks you to pay for the download.  Prepare to get hooked.  \n\n<p/><em>Illustration of Joe Frank by Tony Millionaire for The Believer</em>"

        "description": "<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/harperhallway.jpg\">\n\n<p /><strong>Below is a press release about <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/487/harper-high-school-part-one?promo=1#play\">our next two episodes</a>, which are based on five months of reporting at Harper High School in Chicago.</strong>\n\n<p />NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2013 /<a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wbezs-this-american-life-spends-months-in-a-chicago-high-school-thats-facing-gun-violence-190872611.html\">PRNewswire-USNewswire</a>/ -- This weekend and next, February 15-17 and February 22-24, the public radio show <em>This American Life</em> will devote two full episodes to the violence affecting Harper High School in Chicago. Last school year, 29 current and recent Harper students were shot. Twenty-one were wounded; eight died.\n\n<p />The special episodes begin airing the same day President Obama travels to Chicago to talk about urban gun violence. The number of murders in Chicago climbed last year, while in many big cities like New York and Los Angeles, the number has been steady or declining. Last weekend, 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was buried. She'd been shot in a Chicago city park a week after performing at an inaugural event in Washington.\n\n\n<p />\"For everything we've all heard about children and gun violence,\" says the program's host Ira Glass, \"there are basic things we don't hear so much about. Like what it's like to live in neighborhoods that have to cope with so much bloodshed. This is a school that knows this problem in a way that most of us around the country don't.\"\n\n<p />Harper administration gave three reporters unusual access for a full semester, five months. When violence struck, the reporters recorded the staff as they jumped into action. They recorded private, difficult meetings with families and students. The result is a portrait of school administrators who know their students well, and take energetic measures to keep these teenagers alive.\n\n<p />The level of access given to the reporters resulted in some remarkable stories. Reporter Linda Lutton got shockingly candid answers when she asked a group of students where teenagers get their guns.\n\n<p />Harper's attendance area alone includes more than 15 gangs\u2014Lutton also learned that these gangs operate very differently than they used to. The gangs at Harper shoot each other, but it's almost never about drug territory. Many don't sell drugs. They don't have colors, or wear caps tilted to the right or left. Most important, boys are nearly always assigned a gang affiliation, whether they want it or not, based on where they live.\n\n<p />\"When I ask kids what their parents don't understand about gangs these days,\" Lutton says, \"they say it's this. Their parents tell them not to join a gang\u2014as if there's some initiation to go through, some way to sign up.\" Aaron Washington, a Chicago police officer stationed at Harper, told Lutton that because the only safe way to walk home through gang territory is in a group, there's almost no way for a kid at Harper to avoid affiliating.\n\n<p />Alex Kotlowitz, another reporter for these special episodes, points out that when most of us read about teenagers gunned down, the police almost always identify them as gang members, \"so it's hard not to think they did something to deserve it, that they must've been up to no good, that what goes around, comes around. But life in these neighborhoods is more complicated than that. It's nearly impossible to be unaffiliated.\"\n\n<p />And what are the shootings about? The same things kids argue about anywhere: girls, \"he said-she said\" stuff, money owed, a fistfight. There was a paintball incident involving Harper students that led to real guns going off.\n\n<p />In one story, staff and students learn at a Homecoming pep rally that a recent student was just shot a few blocks away. Principal Leonetta Sanders struggles to decide if she's going to hold two events \u2013 the football game and the dance \u2013 while everyone's worried about retaliation.\n\n<p />In a story in the second episode, a gang member talks movingly about when he and his friends reached a certain age and became targets in the gang wars. \"It's all about height,\" he says. \"They call it 'hard legs.' Shooting at any hard legs. That means any male that looks of age.\" They felt they had no choice but to get guns and fight back.\n\n<p />About our reporters:\n\n<p /><u>Alex Kotlowitz</u> has written about children and violence in Chicago for more than twenty years. His works include the book <em>There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America</em>, the widely-acclaimed documentary <em>The Interrupters</em> and numerous stories for <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>The Chicago Tribune Magazine</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em> and others.\n\n<p /><u>Linda Lutton</u> is an education reporter for WBEZ Chicago. She's also reported for <em>Education Week</em>, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>The Chicago Reader</em>, <em>In These Times</em>, <em>The World</em>, <em>Marketplace</em> and NPR's <em>Morning Edition</em>. Prior to her work at WBEZ, she covered education across 85 school districts in Chicago's south suburbs for the <em>Daily Southtown</em>.\n\n<p /><u>Ben Calhoun</u> is a staff producer for <em>This American Life</em>. Prior to that, he worked as a reporter in WBEZ Chicago's newsroom for eight years and contributed to NPR's <em>Morning Edition</em> and <em>All Things Considered</em>, <em>Radiolab</em>, <em>Marketplace</em> and other programs.\n\n<p /><strong>The <em>This American Life</em> podcast is normally released every Sunday evening. The episodes about Harper High School will be available early, on the evenings of Friday, February 15th and Friday, February 22nd, respectively.</strong>\n\n<p /><em>Photo: Ben Calhoun</em>"

ProPublica, our partner in reporting the story, has uncovered information about one of the soldiers who is wanted by authorities for participating in the massacre, retired Col. C\u00e9sar Ad\u00e1n Rosales Batres. ProPublica found that Batres was living for years in a wealthy, gated community in Guatemala and even served as president of a neighborhood association despite the fact that the massacre charges against him were public. When investigators started looking for him, however, he disappeared and is still at large.

        "description": "<p />Hello <em>This American Life</em> listeners and soon-to-be contributors,\n\n<p />In May of last year, with the help of many contributors, we did a show called <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/434/this-week\">\u201cThis Week.\u201d</a> It was something new for us:  Every single thing in the show was united by the simple fact that it had happened in the seven days prior to broadcast. The idea was to do a kind of \"news\" show in a narrative way, with good characters and some ... feeling. There were small things, like a guy trying to learn Spanish while he drove across country, and an 8 year old who took the training wheels off her bike for the first time. And also big things, like the death of Osama bin Laden. The final product was immediate and energetic -- and great fun to put together.\n\n<p />Now, we'd like to do it again. And again we'd love your help.\n\n<p /><strong>The eligible dates for this \u201cThis Week\u201d show are Saturday, December 1st through Friday, December 7th.</strong>  If you know of anything interesting happening \u2013 to you or someone you know \u2013 between Dec 1st and Dec 7th, we want to hear about it. It can be anything that matters to the people involved - just so long as something, however tiny, is at stake: a first date, a championship game, an audition, a medical diagnosis, the first day of a new business, or the last day of a dying one. \n\n<p />What we\u2019re especially hoping for are some lighter stories. Funny would be good. We\u2019re also short on political stories \u2013 a local politics or news story would be great. Is some huge fight over a stoplight coming to a head the first week of December in your town? Is there any election aftermath playing out in your county in an interesting way?\n\n<p />Even if you don\u2019t know of anything now, please keep your eyes and ears open and, if possible, even make your own recordings.  Most smartphones have recording capabilities so if you come across some scene or event or even just are having an interesting conversation, record it!  If you think it\u2019s something we might want \u2013 just even as a small clip \u2013 email us and let us know what you\u2019ve got and we may ask you to send it. (A note here: you can\u2019t tape anyone secretly.  All parties must know they\u2019re being recorded for possible broadcast.)  One of our favorite moments from the last \u201cThis Week\u201d show was only a few seconds long. It was from a student on a class trip who taped a chaperone telling the kids: Please don\u2019t push each other into the Grand Canyon. It went like this:  \n\n<em><blockquote><p /><strong>Ira Glass</strong>: So much has happened this week. What else? In the Grand Canyon on Wednesday, high school freshman were on a class trip.\n<p /><strong>Lauren</strong>: This is Lauren. We're walking down the trail to go to the Grand Canyon right now.\n<p /><strong>Teacher</strong>: Now. I know you wouldn't push anybody over the edge. But just don't even pretend to do it. OK? It's something we want to avoid. OK?</blockquote></em>\n\n<p />That\u2019s the kind of stuff we\u2019d love to hear. \n\n<p />Please send your pitches to: <a href=\"mailto:thisweek@thislife.org\">thisweek@thislife.org</a>. You can also use that address to let us know if you've made a recording.\n\n<p />Thank you so much, again, for helping us make this show happen. \n\n<p />Sincerely, \n<br>- The staff of <em>This American Life</em>"

Along with Sedaris, there are stories by the now-famous Tig Notaro, Glynn Washington, Ryan Knighton and David Rakoff. Lots of the stories are funny. David Rakoff's is particularly touching. He talks about the abilities he\u2019s lost during his fight with cancer, and then, gracefully, beautifully, does a solo dance onstage. It was the last story Rakoff ever wrote for the radio show. He died three months later, in August. A bit of his dance is included in the trailer above.\n\n<p />OK Go provides music. Monica Bill Barnes & Company dance. Ira Glass tells a story using things he normally can't: photos. Mike Birbiglia casts Terry Gross in a surprising, hilarious little movie. \n\n<p />We're incredibly proud of this show and excited that more people can <a href=\"http://bit.ly/REe0Lr\">see it for just a few dollars</a>. It's also available on <a href=\"https://store.thisamericanlife.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=INVISIBLE-MADE-VISIBLE-DVD\">DVD</a>, for all you object fetishists and gift givers. Though you can actually gift the download, too.\n\n<p />Have fun.\n\n<p />Your friends at <em>This American Life</em>"

It concerned an amateur production of Peter Pan that went badly awry.  This was not surprising.  Happens all the time with that story, even though the last time it appeared on the air \u2013 in rerun \u2013 was during the middle of the Bush Administration. \n\n<p />Jack Hitt, who told the story on the air, has been on our show dozens of times and is hands-down the best natural storyteller I know.  I don\u2019t say that lightly.  He\u2019s deeply curious, very funny, piercingly analytical and a living embodiment of the adage: great stories happen to those who can tell them.  I\u2019m told that magazine editors sometimes make Jack write out his story pitches in email form because when you\u2019re on the phone with him, listening to him describe some story he wants to write, a mist of fairy dust engulfs everything, you\u2019re laughing and you\u2019re charmed and you end up buying everything he wants to sell you.  Email is the only way to preserve a shred of objectivity.\n\n<p />New York City: you have a rare chance to see him tell stories on stage, for the next two weekends at Joe\u2019s Pub.  It\u2019s a small venue.  Act quickly to get tickets. \n\n<p />Jack\u2019s normally a print reporter; this show MAKING UP THE TRUTH is his first time out as a stage performer.  It\u2019s filled with \u2013 as his press release says \u2013 \u201cextravagant, almost unbelievable true stories.\u201d  These are, of course, the very best kind.  They include two of the most popular things we\u2019ve ever put on our air: his Peter Pan fiasco story, and his story about an inept apartment \u201csuper\u201d who claimed to be a former South American killer.  Jack tells these and other tales, talks about the mechanics of the brain and what happens when we tell the truth and when we lie.  After each show, the Public Theater is hosting an interview with Jack in the lobby mezzanine (where there\u2019s a bar) and a conversation with the audience, led by Nicholas Thompson of The <em>New Yorker</em> on November 11 and by Catherine Burns from The Moth November 17. \n\n<p />Jack\u2019s awesome. He doesn\u2019t do this very much. Because of the hurricane they actually have some tickets left.  That\u2019s lucky for you. Consider grabbing them.\n\n<p /><strong>The Show: <em>Making Up the Truth</em><br>\nWhere: Joe's Pub at the Public Theater<br>\nWhen: Sunday Nov 11, Saturday Nov 17<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,6370\">TICKETS</a><br> \nAnd for public radio listeners, a discount: $5 off ticket price with the code JPTIXA2</strong>\n\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.joespub.com/component/option,com_shows/task,view/Itemid,40/id,6370\"><img src=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/jackhittposter.jpg></a>"

Yesterday we got an answer &mdash; and it demonstrates how the state's huge House of Representatives is so very representative, so responsive to shifts in public mood. After giving Republicans a three-to-one majority in the House and Senate in 2010, voters have swung the other way. Here's what we know so far: Early numbers have the Democrats taking 217 seats to the Republicans' 177, with six seats still undetermined. Speaker Bill O'Brien won his House seat, but he won't be speaker again, because Republicans not only lost their majority, they lost the House entirely. Reporters in New Hampshire are saying that Bill O'Brien won't be seeking any leadership position at all.</p>"

In it, I teach teenaged girls how to make balloon animals while &mdash; and here\u2019s where it gets a little odd, I admit &mdash; I answer their questions about crushes and BJs and other pressing issues in their lives.  2)  I wanted to make sure our teenaged listeners and parents of teenaged girls know about <em>Rookie</em>.  Because <em>Rookie</em> is awesome.\n\n<p />Okay, first the video. <em>Rookie</em> does a series called \"Ask a Grown Man\" where guys like <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/01/ask-a-grown-man-2/\">Paul Rudd</a>, <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/05/ask-a-grown-man-5/\">Jon Hamm</a> and <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/06/ask-a-grown-man-6/\">Judd Apatow</a> answer teenagers\u2019 questions about boys in their lives and boys in general. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/04/ask-a-grown-man-4/\">BJ Novak</a> did the best one ever, only rivaled by <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/10/ask-a-grown-woman-paula-pell/\">Paula Pell</a>. \n\n<p /><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/51839808\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/51839808\">Balloon Animals: A Video Tutorial by Ira Glass</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/user8507443\">Rookie</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n\n<p />Okay, more about <em>Rookie</em>.  <em>Rookie</em> was started by a then-15-year-old Tavi Gevinson (she\u2019s 16 now and a junior at a public high school) who felt that most of the culture being made for (and sold to) girls her age didn\u2019t speak to her actual experience.  The 90\u2019s had <em>My So-Called Life</em> and <em>Sassy</em> magazine and <em>Freaks and Geeks</em>.  There\u2019s no equivalent today. Teen girl magazines are deeply concerned with tips on getting a boy or getting thin for summer bathing suits. That wasn\u2019t so interesting to Tavi. She wanted to make something that wouldn\u2019t talk down to teenagers.  As Tavi says in <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/09/editors-letter/\">her first editor\u2019s letter</a>: \n\n<p />\"<em>Rookie</em> is not your guide to Being a Teen. It is not a pamphlet on How to Be a Young Woman. (If it were, it would be published by American Girl and your aunt would\u2019ve given it to you in the fifth grade.) It is, quite simply, a bunch of writing and art we like and believe in.\"\n\n<p />The result is a hilarious, sometimes moving, beautifully art-directed mix of personal stories, essays about TV shows and movies, photo shoots, original songs, and candy reviews.  It simultaneously takes itself very seriously &mdash; and has the courage of its convictions &mdash; and doesn\u2019t take itself seriously at all. Which is of course the best combination a person could hope for.\n\n<p />Some representative posts:  <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/09/higher-learning/\">Advice on</a> how to get through high school from Joss Whedon, Zooey Deschanel, Dan Savage, Fred Armisen, Jack Black and other famouses.  <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/03/lindsay-edit/\">An appreciation</a> of <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> from someone way too young to have seen it when it first was broadcast. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/06/ltbte-joan-didion/\">An appreciation</a> of Joan Didion. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/09/male-gaze/\">Tavi writing</a> about getting to the age when girls start to get cat calls. Months later all the <em>Rookie</em> writers had <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/05/it-happens-all-the-time/ \">this conversation</a> about being harassed on the street. A teenaged photographer\u2019s <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/08/heaven-tonight/ \">photo essay on heaven</a> and her <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/10/moving-walkways/\">3-D photo essay in Japan</a>. I love the photography on <em>Rookie</em>. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/10/drugs-for-children/\">Candy reviews</a>, \nmore <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/12/holiday-candy-roundup/\">candy reviews</a>, and <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/10/candy-is-delicious/\">a candy review video</a> by the cast of <em>Parks and Rec</em>. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/10/crown-of-love/\">DIY how to</a> make a flower crown,  <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/04/how-to-do-a-beehive/\">DIY how to</a> do a two-minute beehive, <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/10/diy-bitchface/\">DIY how to</a> make a bitchface.

Jenny\u2019s <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/05/parent-tra/\">story</a> on parents who don\u2019t let you out of the house.  Sady\u2019s <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/09/on-falling-apart/\">story</a> about being diagnosed with a mental illness. <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2012/05/may-16-2012/5/\">Ruby's diary</a> (real teenage diaries are a weekly feature on <em>Rookie</em>) the week after her mom died, writing about the funeral.  Her heartbreaking closing lines: \"It was a beautiful day, but she would have been freezing. She was always cold.\" And finally, a <a href=\"http://rookiemag.com/2011/09/hands-off/\">story</a> by Miranda July on her first feminist action which justifies the whole mission of the website all on its own.\n\n<p />There\u2019s also <a href=\" http://www.amazon.com/Rookie-Yearbook-One-Tavi-Gevinson/dp/1770461124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1350934841&sr=8-1&keywords=rookie\">a book of greatest hits</a> from the first year of <em>Rookie</em>.\n\n<p />Full disclosure: my wife helps Tavi run the site. Yes, her boss is a high school junior.  \n\n<p />Tavi started writing a fashion blog called <em><a href=\"http://www.thestylerookie.com/\">Style Rookie</a></em> when she was 11. She\u2019s such a funny and honest and interesting writer that soon she was noticed not as a kid novelty act but in <em>The Guardian</em>'s list (and others' lists) of best fashion bloggers. Big designers became fans and started flying her as their guest of honor to shows in Paris and Japan.  At the New York runway shows she sits next to Anna Wintour, of <em>Vogue</em>.  Early on, when the <em>New York Times</em> got in touch wanting to write about <em>Style Rookie</em>, Tavi had to reveal to her parents that she\u2019d been quietly writing a blog. <em>The New Yorker</em> also <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/09/20/100920fa_fact_widdicombe\">wrote a profile</a>.  <a href=\"http://www.thestylerookie.com/2008/07/look-what-cat-dragged-in.html\">Here\u2019s</a> her 12-year-old style. <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2247337?ab\">Here\u2019s</a> an early video from <em>Style Rookie</em> days where she performs a rap she wrote about the Comme des Garcons collaboration with H&M (her parents let her go to school late that day so she could make it to the store first thing in the morning). <a href=\"http://www.thestylerookie.com/2010/02/girl-power.html\">Here</a> she discovers feminism, years ago.  <a href=\"http://www.thestylerookie.com/2011/03/i-feel-like-photo-to-accompany-this.html\">Here</a> she announces she's not that into fashion anymore (causing an outcry from the Fashion Blog Community).  \n\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/0611412_ira&tavi059.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/iratavi.jpg\"></a>\n\n<p />This photo was taken for an article someone wrote about the two of us. Yes, Tavi and I know smoking is bad. No, neither of us smokes. Yes, we just thought it would make an interesting picture. Yes, we\u2019re hoping children won\u2019t start smoking because we were photographed with cigarettes. If you\u2019re a child looking at this picture now: please don\u2019t smoke.\n\n<p /><em>Image by Kyoko Hamada.</em>"

You only have a few days to <a href=\"http://nyuskirball.org/calendar/monicabillbarnes\">get tickets</a>. I\u2019ll be joining them onstage. Not to dance. That would be horrible. But I\u2019ll introduce them, and talk to them a little about their work, which is very different from most dance companies.  \n\n<p />I\u2019ve seen big chunks of the material they\u2019ll be performing and it\u2019s all pretty great. Their thought is that there\u2019s an audience out there which doesn\u2019t go to dance performances which might like what they do, and I have to say I agree 100% with that. I barely ever go to dance, and sometimes don\u2019t feel like I \"get\" dance. But their work is immediate and emotional and sometimes truly really funny.  \n\n<p />If you saw them in our live show, you know what I\u2019m talking about. For weeks after that show, people asked me where they could see a full show.  I\u2019m here with this message to you, saying the place you see them is <a href=\"http://nyuskirball.org/calendar/monicabillbarnes\">Skirball Center, in New York, Saturday night or Sunday afternoon</a>. If you come out, I think you\u2019ll have the same experience I had when I first saw them perform. I\u2019m confident you won\u2019t be disappointed. They\u2019re out to entertain.\n\n<p />Ira"

The man then abducted Oscar, who was three years old at the time, to raise him as his own son. This past Saturday, Oscar received a letter from the U.S. government granting him asylum in this country. The Guatemalan military is still powerful, and Oscar had argued that he could be in danger if he were sent back to Guatemala, since he's living proof of a military crime. \n\n<p />Also last week, one of the soldiers who allegedly took part in the massacre at Dos Erres, Jorge Vinicio Sosa Orantes, was extradited from Canada back to California, where he will stand trial for immigration violations related to the Dos Erres massacre. Sosa lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years before fleeing to Canada as U.S. authorities closed in on him. The U.S. government has charged him with concealing his involvement in the massacre when he applied for U.S. residency and citizenship.\n\n<p />You can read more about <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/guatemalan-massacre-survivor-wins-political-asylum-in-u.s\">Oscar's asylum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-charges-for-accused-commando-in-dos-erres-massacre\">Sosa's extradition</a> at ProPublica's web site. \n\n<p /><em>Image: Oscar Ram&iacute;rez Casta&ntilde;eda, photographed by Matthew Healey for ProPublica</em>"

Ira Glass will introduce the show and moderate a post-show discussion with the performers.</strong> \n\n<p />Ira writes:\n\n<blockquote><p />I first saw Monica Bill Barnes & Company in June 2011. I'll be honest, I don't go to a lot of dance, but their show was the most charmingly alive dance performance I've ever seen. While it was going on, all I could think was, \u2018I want to see this again. How do I see this again? How do I bring everyone I've ever met to this?\u2019\n\n<p />And I kept thinking something that makes no sense: How do I put this on the radio?  People who like our show would like this too.  Of course that's insane.  You can't put dance on the radio.  So instead, we created this event where we did an episode of the radio show onstage in May 2012 and beamed it into movie theaters, with dances by MBB & Co.\n\n<p />I'm not sure I have the vocabulary to express what's so special about what they do, but somehow, it feels like I'm seeing feelings and moments I can relate to, expressed in movement. I find myself watching the dancers' faces like I've rarely done in dance. They're super-expressive. And somehow they seem like regular people up there - not ballerinas or modern dance artistes.  And I like that so many of their pieces seem interested in awkward moments, striving moments and moments of overblown faux triumph.  I relate to that.\n\n<p />After we did that episode onstage in May, a show filled with incredible performances by David Sedaris, David Rakoff and Tig Notaro, the most common question I was asked was 'Who were those dancers?' People kept coming up to me saying 'I don't like dance. I don't go to dance. I want to see them again.' Which, yes, is a weird thing to say about an entire art form, but the point is, they won a lot of fans that night and I think when people see a full MBB & Co. show, they'll be even more wowed.  I'm excited to see them again at <a href=\"http://nyuskirball.org/calendar/monicabillbarnes\">Skirball</a> and I bet <em>This American Life</em> fans who saw them in May won't be disappointed.</blockquote>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mbb2.jpg\">\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mbb3.jpg\">\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mbb5.jpg\">\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mbb4.jpg\">\n<p /><em>Monica Bill Barnes, Anna Bass and Christina Robson performing in our May 10th live show.

        "description": "<p><strong>Ira writes:</strong></p>  \n\n<p>At the 2:00 Chicago show of <em>Sleepwalk</em>, during the Q&A, a woman named Kathleen said she came to the film because the tagline on the poster \"A comedy for anyone who's ever had a dream \u2026 and then jumped out a window\" applied to her. She sleepwalks, she jumped out a third story window in New York. She wasn't hurt in the slightest because she landed on the fire escape that was there. She's never seen a doctor. I asked her if seeing our film &mdash; where Mike nearly dies from his sleepwalking &mdash; convinced her to see a sleep specialist. Nope. Not even close. So much for the redeeming power of art to affect our lives. She came onstage and we talked about it and I had the audience take photos of her to post at #seesleepwalk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/seesleepwalk\">on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://statigr.am/tag/seesleepwalk/\">Instagram</a>, hoping the peer pressure might convince her to get herself to a doctor. You can see them there. And send your best wishes to her.</p>\n\n<p><center><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/sleepwalk.jpg\"></center></p>\n\n<p> Finally I gave her all the money in my wallet and asked her to spend it on a doctor. This is the second young woman at a screening like this. The first was in San Francisco at the Embarcadero Theater. She'd once been stopped by her friend's sister before jumping off a balcony in her sleep. Had never seen a doctor. The film didn't convince her either. I love that our weirdly specific poster tagline got one person into the theater. How many people have had a dream and then jumped out a window?  Who knew that this was a market to exploit? That said, since 4% of the population has sleep disorders, we've talked about special 4 a.m. screenings just for them. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update!</strong> Here's a video from the Q&A:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/p3Q6Eo3zB1c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

        "description": "<p /><strong>Ira writes:</strong>\n\n<p />Thanks to all of you who came out for the opening weekend of <em>Sleepwalk with Me</em> in New York. We set a record!\n  \n<p />The weekend box office was $68,801 at IFC Center.  We are told that no first-time American director has ever earned as high a per-screen average.  At least, if you don't count animated films like <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>.  \n\n<p />Previous record-holders: the comedy documentary <em>The Aristocrats</em> ($60,949 per screen) and <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> ($56,002 per screen).  \n\n<p />Only <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> and <em>To Rome with Love</em> have had a higher per screen averages this year.\n\n<p />As a joke, <em>Avengers</em> director Joss Whedon <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6_020FFXU&feature=youtu.be\">declared war</a> on our film a few weeks ago.  But what started as a joke has now become deadly serious. <em>The Avengers</em> per screen average on its opening weekend: $47,698, considerably lower than ours.  Thus we have done what Loki could not.  We beat <em>The Avengers</em>.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Ira_and_Mike.jpg\">\n\n<p />Of course, they were in 4,349 theaters with that average.  We were in one.  We would have to continue selling tickets at this rate for the next 66 years before we would earn what they earned in their very first weekend.  \n\n<p />You can see many more of our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thisamericanlife/sets/72157631270980410/\">photos from the weekend here</a>. You can also search Twitter or Instagram for #SeeSleepwalk.\n\n<p />This coming weekend, <a href=\"http://www.sleepwalkmovie.com/screenings\">we open in over twenty cities</a>. You can <a href=\"http://www.sleepwalkmovie.com/screenings\">buy tickets online</a> for many of them already.  Get yours now because shows are selling out!  And you can still <a href=\"http://www.sleepwalkmovie.com/bring-us\">ask your local theater</a> to book <em>Sleepwalk with Me.</em>  Like any comedy, it's more fun to see in a theater, with a crowd.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Audience.jpg\">\n\n<em>Photos by Adrianne Mathiowetz.</em>"

        "description": "<p>This week\u2019s episode, \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/471/the-convert\">The Convert</a>,\"  was about FBI informant Craig Monteilh, who went undercover in southern California\u2019s Muslim community to try to find people who were recruiting and training terrorists. Craig\u2019s operation, which took place in 2006 and 2007, was called Operation Flex.</p>\n \n<p>On Tuesday, a federal judge <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mosque-spying-20120815,0,7626350.story\">dismissed a lawsuit</a> that was filed against the FBI as a result of Operation Flex. Several people Craig spied on &mdash; including Yasser AbdelRahim, who was featured in our episode &mdash; sued the Bureau, claiming it had violated their first amendment rights during Operation Flex by targeting them because of their religious beliefs, and that they\u2019d been subjected to searches and monitoring without a warrant.</p>\n \n<p>In response, the government asserted the state secrets privilege, arguing that the suit shouldn\u2019t be allowed to move forward because it would force the FBI to reveal classified information and would put national security at risk.</p>\n \n<p>U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney sided with the government. After reviewing confidential statements from top FBI officials, Carney wrote in his decision that allowing the suit to proceed could \"significantly compromise national security.\"</p>\n \n<p>It was a difficult decision, according to Carney. He compared himself to an ancient Greek hero:</p>\n \n<p><em>In struggling with this conflict, the Court is reminded of the classic dilemma of Odysseus, who faced the challenge of navigating his ship through a dangerous passage, flanked by a voracious six-headed monster, on the one side, and a deadly whirlpool, on the other. Odysseus opted to pass by the monster and risk a few of his individual sailors, rather than hazard the loss of his entire ship to the sucking whirlpool. Similarly, the proper application of the state secrets privilege may unfortunately mean the sacrifice of individual liberties for the sake of national security.</em></P>\n\n<p>We reached out to the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU, and the Council on American Islamic Relations, CAIR, who are representing the people Craig spied on. Peter Bibring, an attorney at the ACLU, sent us this statement:</p>\n \n<p><em>As troubling as we find the implications that it might be okay to feed the Muslim community to a monster, it's a mistake to think that closing courts to claims of religious discrimination in the name of national security affects only the few who bring those cases.  The government that refuses to let courts determine whether it has violated our most basic Constitutional values because the whole matter is supposedly secret steers our nation into much more dangerous waters.  It's wrongheaded, in the name of defending freedom, to give up its hallmarks, including the basic balance of powers our founders so carefully set. </em></p>\n\n<p>The judge\u2019s dismissal means that the case against the FBI cannot move forward. But the plaintiffs are also suing individual FBI agents who were involved in Operation Flex, and Carney did allow certain charges against them to stand. Bibring said the ACLU and CAIR plan to appeal the judge\u2019s decision.</p>"

Thank you for all your help, and keep calling and emailing and tweeting your theaters!</strong>\n\n<h2>Ira writes:</h2>\n\n<p />We need your help with our movie and yes, if you haven't heard, we made a movie! It's called <em>Sleepwalk with Me</em> and it's not a documentary. It's a comedy, written and directed by Mike Birbiglia and starring him also, with Lauren Ambrose and Carol Kane, plus cameos by Marc Maron, Kristen Schaal, Wyatt Cenac, Jesse Klein and lots of other comedians. It won a big award at Sundance and brought down the house at SXSW. \n\n<p />I don't say this lightly: it's as good as anything we've ever done on our show. As good as our very best episodes. Except maybe funnier. Shot by the same genius cinematographer who shot our TV series. Co-written by, um, me. The trailer's above.\n\n<p />It premieres at the end of August and you'll be hearing more about it before then, but I'm writing this now because any small indie film has a hard time getting booked into theaters and <em>Sleepwalk</em> is a small indie film. This is the part where we need your help. We want you to have the chance to see the movie on the big screen and we want to enlist you in our campaign to get it shown in your town. \n\n<p /><strong><a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sleepwalkwithme#screenings\">Here</a> is the list of 125 theaters</strong> where <em>Sleepwalk</em> is currently booked. If your town isn't on this list, or if you live in the suburbs and it's hard to get to the Music Box in Chicago or the IFC Center in Manhattan, if you live in L.A. but nowhere near the Nuart (west of the 405), if you're outside DC far from E Street or near San Francisco and don't want the hassle of driving into the city, you don't have to take that lying down. Here's a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sleepwalkwithme/request\"><strong>list of theaters that run indie films</strong></a>, with their phone numbers, email addresses and twitter handles. Call them, email them, tweet at them with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23BringSleepwalk\">#BringSleepwalk</a>. Tell them to book <em>Sleepwalk with Me</em> ASAP. <strong>(Note: you can ask ANY theater to book the film. That's just a list of theaters that regularly book film from our distributor IFC. So if your favorite theater isn't on there, still ask them.)</strong> \n\n<p />Thanks for your help. We are new to the movie business and have no power or influence there at all. The one superpower we have... is you.\n\n<p />-Ira"

        "description": "<p />There's been quite a lot of fallout in the two weeks since we aired our <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/468/switcheroo?act=2\">story about Journatic</a> (episode 468, \"Switcheroo\"). In case you missed it: Journatic is a company that outsources labor to generate \u201chyperlocal\u201d news content for newspapers all over the country. To create this content cheaply, it uses offshore researchers and writers, especially from the Philippines. The detail in our story that got newspaper editors worked up, though, was this: In real estate stories done by Journatic's sister company, Blockshopper, writers (both American and Filipino) were routinely using pseudonyms, which meant fake names were making their way into major daily newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune, The Houston Chronicle, The San Francisco Chronicle, and others.\n\n<p />Evidently, the editors of those papers didn't know this was going on. And once they did, they were very unhappy. Several papers have dropped Journatic, and there's some strife at Journatic internally as well. Its editorial chief quit.\n\n<p />The Chicago Tribune (Tribune Co. is a major Journatic investor, by the way) launched an internal investigation, and then <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/noad/ct-chicago-tribune-suspends-use-of-journatic-07132012,0,3406697.story\">\nsuspended its use of Journatic content</a>.\n\n<p />Here's media blogger Jim Romenesko <a href=\"http://jimromenesko.com/2012/07/13/chicago-tribune-suspends-use-of-journatic/\">on the subject</a>. His post includes the internal memo sent to Tribune employees. Also in this post: Journatic's editorial chief explains why he just quit. \n\n<p />Here's <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/179928/chicago-sun-times-ends-journatic-relationship-as-dozens-of-fake-bylines-discovered-at-more-papers/\">Poynter's roundup</a> of newspapers that have canceled their deals with Journatic.  \n\n<p />And here's <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/181009/journatic-published-hundreds-of-stories-under-fake-bylines-on-houston-chronicle-websites/\">another from Poynter,</a> showing how Journatic used fake bylines on other local news stories (Journatic's CEO had insisted the fake bylines were limited to real estate stories)."

We got three responses, none of them matching the woman at MoMA who ran into Ira and Etgar, and told them that she was Cindy Sherman. Lance Weiss wrote:\n\n<blockquote><p />The day before the exhibit was closing at MOMA my wife and I went to see it.\n\n<p />We were just about at the end when we saw a woman who was dressed over the top in a rock meets punk meets disco way. She was white, late 50s with a short, spiky, multicolored hair/wig, layered scarves, colorful blouse and hanging leather strap waist length necklaces with metal legends like \"Rock and Roll.\"\n\n<p />She was by herself, carefully going through the exhibit and drawing a certain amount of initial attention and then New Yorker blas\u00e9 acceptance. But you could see that several attendees -- myself included -- began to think that it was Cindy Sherman.\n\n<p />I was semi-stalking her, trying to compare her mouth to the way the mouth went down more on one side in many of the pictures in the exhibit. Finally my wife just decided to ask her. She said she wasn't but that she was really pleased that we thought she was. She said her name was Jerrie Disco and she worked for Hypergenic magazine, neither of which turned up later in a Google search. She took a picture of herself with me in the background. We chatted very pleasantly a little more and left unsure, wondering if that photo was ever going to be the basis for something.</blockquote>\n\n\n<p />A listener named David White sent this, saying \"I know it was really her:\"\n\n\n<blockquote>I posted this on my Facebook page on March 3rd. The day after the experience.\n\n<p />I MET CINDY SHERMAN: On the 5th floor of MoMA, Cindy Sherman has a\nretrospective show of her life's work. The work uses costumes and makeup to\ncomment on and obscure her identity or role as a woman, artist, and human. Last\nnight as I walked around staring at the portraits of one of the most influential\nfeminist artist in the world I was looking into the only common denominator in\nall her work, her eyes. Several points of the evening I made eye contact with a\namazingly overweight woman, that looked to be more interested in the people in\nthe gallery, than the work. I suddenly realized that the eye's in the photos\nwhere the very same as ones of the woman in the crowd. The more I looked the\nmore sure I was. Cindy was taking in the height of her life's work in perfect\nmakeup and a fat suit. I introduced myself and she introduced herself as Terry,\nthen later as Debbie when someone she had met earlier in the evening walked up.\nWe spoke about art, society, banned work and the immensity of the show. I\nrealize what I write here can never recreate the experience or accurately\nportray what it was like...\n\n<p />To expand, I was with a friend and as I sat with Cindy, My friend came sat down next\nto me. I introduced my friend Crystal to \"Terry.\" All the while her not knowing Cindy and my little secret.\nCindy and I kept talking. She said that she had came to the event through a meet up group. Where their plan\nwas to go to the exhibition and then to dinner afterward to talk about the show. I was exhausted from my day at work and probably not showing my interest in the show but that couldn't be less true. I've admired Cindy since I first learned of her in college. I was surprised to see the expanse of her work. I didn't know about her darker period and her banned work. While talking with Cindy we discussed how I thought shock art was dead considering the state of media.\n\n<p />The point I knew it was her was when she walked by me after making eye contact\nfor the third time. I saw her eyes they were the same as the eyes in her work. She\nlooked to be 300 lbs in her fat suit, it doesn't seem right to call it a fat suit... Anyway, as she walked by me she was amazingly\nlight on her feet and I saw her skip for just a second. I knew then... she said\nhi and sat down. I looked at her face and the makeup was flawless. That costume was flawless. It must of cost thousands of dollars...</blockquote>\n\n\n<p />And finally, an artist named Tim Sheesley sent this interestingly ambivalent sighting:\n\n\n<blockquote><p />I was so happy to hear that someone else saw Cindy Sherman at MOMA. You made my day. I thought I was delusional.\n\n<p />Here's my story. On Friday May 18 at 1:30 I purchased my ticket for MOMA. At about 2:15 I made it to the Sherman exhibit. Having known about Cindy Sherman's work for some time I never really got a good full scale big show overview of her work and I thought this would be a great time to see what her work was all about. Either I would get it or I wouldn't.\n\n<p />I went up the escalator and was confronted by those big portrait photos out side of the galleries. I studied those pictures carefully. They were impressive. I started to watch the crowd a bit and I spotted someone standing off to the side near the balcony railing also watching the crowd. I thought that person looks kind of like the person in these photos. I started looking back and forth between the photos and the person watching us. Then our eyes met and I realized that she was watching me watch her. I was all but certain that it was Cindy. We were about 30 feet apart. Then I doubted myself and thought I must be crazy. I thought about walking up to her and asking if she was Cindy but I decided not to. \n\n<p />I went through the exhibition and could not shake thinking I saw the real Cindy. By the time I finished looking at those photos I started looking at the people looking at the photos and by this time lots of the people looking at the photos looked like many of the stereotypes she was portraying. Her show really got to me! It was great.\n\n<p />So if it was Cindy that was really cool. If it wasn't that is even more cool because in a way everyone is Cindy. Whatever happened, it made me see her work in a way that I would never have understood it. \n\n<p />So my question to you is was she really making regular visits, or was it a hired Cindy look-alike, or was the work that strong to make us think we really saw her?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p />We sent these accounts to Cindy Sherman. She replied that none of them were her.\n\n<p />The exhibit moves to <a href=\"http://www.sfmoma.org/exhib_events/exhibitions/448\">San Francisco MoMA</a> this coming weekend. It's great, by the way.  Bay Area listeners - if you spot the artist, spot someone impersonating the artist, or decide to impersonate the artist yourself, please drop us a line!

My last paragraph:\n\n<p /><blockquote>Jane's hope is that some brave network &mdash; AMC? NBC? &mdash; will notice their little experiment and give them a budget larger than the cost of a Hyundai to blow people's minds on real TV. If they do it right, of course, they won't be blowing minds at all. They'll just be the New Normal.</blockquote>\n\n<p />Okay, fast forward till today.  Maybe you've seen the ads that've started running for the new NBC series about a gay couple?  Stars that guy from Book of Mormon who was so great as Hannah's ex-boyfriend in Girls?  Created by the guy who did <em>Glee</em>?  Its name?  <em><a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/the-new-normal/\">The New Normal</a></em>.\n\n<p />That is the incredible influence of this blog at the highest levels of show business."

He also found out that his biological father, Tranquilino Casta&ntilde;eda, survived the massacre and is still alive. For thirty years, neither Oscar nor Tranquilino knew the other existed. Oscar thought the soldier who took him was his real father. And Tranquilino thought his entire family had been killed at the massacre.\n\n<p />And then, on Monday, the two met face-to-face. Tranquilino, who's 70, left Guatemala for the first time, and landed at Newark Airport, where Oscar was waiting with his wife and four children. ProPublica, one of our partners in reporting this story, was there, and they've posted this video of the reunion:\n\n<p /><iframe width=\"490\" height=\"276\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4mC38Qn-aUg?showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p />A print version of Oscar and Tranquilino's story is also available on <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/finding-oscar-massacre-memory-and-justice-in-guatemala\">ProPublica's web site</a>, and as an <a href=\"http://www.openroadmedia.com/authors/propublica.aspx\">e-book</a>.

Here's a little recap, including photos by Adrianne Mathiowetz (who is our web manager and also a Minnesota-based <a href=\"http://www.adriannemathiowetz.com/\">photographer</a>). You can see an entire Flickr gallery with 180 photos from the show <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/thisamericanlife/sets/72157629836058068/\">here</a>.\n\n<p />On Thursday, May 10th we performed an episode of the radio show on stage at <a href=\"skirballcenter.nyu.edu/\">NYU's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts</a>, and sent it via satellite into movie theaters all over the US and Canada (Some upcoming screenings in the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/cinema/independent\">US</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/cinema/australia\">Australia</a> too). The show was called \"The Invisible Made Visible,\" and was half stories and half visual things that could never work on the radio - things like dance, animation, a short film, and interactive music performance. The <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/464/invisible-made-visible\">radio version</a> airs this weekend. If you missed the show, fear not. It'll be available on DVD and as a download in a few months.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/iranotes.jpg\" width=\"490\">\n<br>\nIra Glass making some notes on his script before the show.<br>\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/truck.jpg\" width=\"490\">\n<br>\nTo run a show like this, you need one of those big RV-sized production trucks. The director, David Stern, is wearing white in the center in the above photo. He calls the shots live from the seven cameras, like at a sporting event. We had five stationary cameras, one steadicam, and one jib (a small crane that can swoop around the room).

Claire and Vincent also created the curtain animations that appeared on screen throughout the show.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/iraprologue.jpg\" width=\"490\">\n<br>Ira performing the prologue, about a blind guy named Ryan Knighton trying to find the phone in a hotel room. This story featured 112 illustrations by Jeff Turley.<br> \n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/ryan.jpg\" width=\"490\">\nNext, <a href=\"http://www.ryanknighton.com/\">Ryan Knighton</a> himself took the stage to tell a story, about struggling to get his daughter to understand his blindness. Ryan has written two memoirs, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586484400/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thiamelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1586484400\"><em>Cockeyed</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307396703/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thiamelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307396703\"><em>C'mon Papa</em></a>.

We all performed a bit of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as a warm-up, then launched into OK Go's \"Needing/Getting.\"\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/okgosilhouette.jpg\" width=\"490\">\n OK Go's <a href=\"http://hypercompact.com/\">Andy Ross</a> coded the mobile apps that people used to play along. Morgan Knutson designed the app visuals. And <a href=\"http://phoobis.com/\">John Kuramoto</a> did the video.<br> \n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mbbsitting.jpg\" width=\"490\">\nIra's inspiration for the show was seeing a dance performance by <a href=\"http://www.monicabillbarnes.com/\">Monica Bill Barnes & Company</a>. He felt that their sensibility matched the radio show, and started building the live show around the idea \"things you can't do on the radio.\" Here, Anna Bass, Christina Robson and Monica Bill Barnes watch rehearsal.<br> \n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/anna.jpg\" width=\"490\">\nThe first dance was a solo by Anna Bass, set to Nina Simone's \"Let It Be Me\".<br> \n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/glynn.jpg\" width=\"490\"><br>\nNext, Glynn Washington told a story about using supernatural means to find well water. Glynn hosts the public radio show and podcast <a href=\"http://www.snapjudgment.org\">Snap Judgment</a>. \n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/glynnandpat.jpg\" width=\"490\"><br>\nGlynn was accompanied by Snap Judgment producer Pat Mesiti-Miller on music and sound effects.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/tig.jpg\" width=\"490\">Then comedian <a href=\"http://www.tignation.com\">Tig Notaro</a> told a story about repeatedly meeting 1980s pop star <a href=\"http://www.taylordayne.com\">Taylor Dayne</a>. \n\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/tigtaylorwide.jpg\" width=\"490\">After her story, we surprised Tig with a serenade by... Taylor Dayne. She sang \"I'll Always Love You.\" Tig, who showed off some pretty sweet dance moves during Taylor's song, co-hosts the podcast <a href=\"http://www.professorblastoff.com/\">Professor Blastoff</a> and has a new standup album called <a href=\"\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055HK75Q/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thia\nmelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0055HK75Q\">Good One</a>.<br>\n\n<p /><iframe width=\"490\" height=\"276\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YTVFNZKuN-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nThen Ira showed a new short film that comedian <a href=\"http://birbigs.com/\">Mike Birbiglia</a> made for the show. It features Terry Gross of NPR's Fresh Air... and clears up the question of what Terry does when she's not doing interviews. Mike's feature film <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SleepwalkMovie\"><em>Sleepwalk With Me</em></a> comes out on August 24th (produced and co-written by Ira Glass).\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/iravivian.jpg\" width=\"490\">\nNext, Ira told a story that took advantage of our ability to show visuals. It was about a photographer named Vivian Maier, who shot rolls of film every day for dozens of years - brilliant shots of street life - but never showed the photos to anyone. A guy named John Maloof discovered the negatives, and put out <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576875776/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thiamelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1576875776\">a book of Maier's photos</a>. Rich Cahan and Mike Williams also appear in the story, and have another book of Maier's photos coming out in September. Miki Meek helped produce the story. Adam Beckman filmed the interviews. Becky Laks did video editing.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/rakoffcolor.jpg\" width=\"490\">\nThen David Rakoff took the stage, to tell a very emotional story about dance and cancer. David is the author of several books, most recently <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385525249/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thiamelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385525249\"><em>Half Empty</em></a>. At one point David left the microphone, seemingly walking off stage, then broke into dance.

        "description": "<p />Dear fellow political nerds,\n\n<p />Ben Calhoun and Alex Blumberg here, with something we thought you might enjoy: an extended version of the interview that we, along with NPR's Andrea Seabrook, did with Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and former Senator Russ Feingold (D-WI).  We did this as part of our episode on lobbying and campaign finance, <a href=\"http://tal.fm/461\">Take The Money And Run For Office</a>.  \n\n<p />McCain and Feingold don't need a lot of introduction, and one of the things they\u2019re most well-known for is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \u2013 known to people in DC as BCRA (pronounced bick-RAH), and known to people most other places as \u201cMcCain-Feingold.\u201d\n\n<p />We wanted to speak to the two of them because when the US Supreme Court drastically changed American politics with its Citizens United decision, it effectively undid a lot of what McCain-Feingold had done.  BCRA\u2019s goal was to limit the flow of money into American politics. The Citizens United decision arguably opened up the door for more money in politics than ever before.\n\n<p />We wanted to talk to McCain and Feingold about how they felt about the reforms they fought so hard to pass, now that they\u2019ve been significantly undermined by the Supreme Court. \n\n<p />We knew both men had a reputations for being candid, and figured they wouldn\u2019t like the decision much, but we walked out of the interview surprised at how blunt and openly angry they were.  We were also surprised how openly critical they were of the court.  When we talked afterward, we realized that each of us thought, at several points during the interview, \"I can't believe that was the 2008 Republican nominee for president talking like that.\" \n\n<p />The conversation left a real impression on all three of us.\n\n<p />It is also \u2013 as far we know, and as far as they and their staffs can recall \u2013 the first interview they\u2019ve done together in years.\n\n<p />So, given all that, we wanted to offer this extended version of our conversation with them. \n\n<p />One word of caution, both of them talk like people who have lived and breathed this stuff for years.  They assume a certain amount of knowledge about the law they passed, about Citizens United, about how fundraising works.  If you're a level 10 political nerd, it won't be an issue, go ahead and hit play right below.  \n\n<p />For everyone else, we\u2019ve put together a quick primer of two or three things you should know going into this, so you don't get tripped up.  You\u2019ll find it immediately below the audio.\n\n<p /><strong>Listen to McCain-Feingold Uncut:</strong><br><audio src=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/TAL461_bonus_McCain_Feingold_extended.mp3\"></audio> <a href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/TAL461_bonus_McCain_Feingold_extended.mp3\">Download Audio</a>. <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL_461bonus_McCain_Feingold_Transcript.pdf\"> Transcript</a>.\n\n<p /><strong>McCain-Feingold</strong> \u2013 The actual name of the law was Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.  This law did a few different things.  But in a nutshell, the key things to know about this are:\n\n<p />A long time ago, corporations and unions had been banned from contributing directly to candidates.  And in the 1970\u2019s, limits were placed on how much individuals could give to candidates.  But even after that, unions, corporations, and wealthy donors would get around those restrictions by giving unlimited amounts of money to the parties.  The parties would then spread that money around, using it in elections all over the country.  This was called \u201csoft money.\u201d  McCain-Feingold attempted to get this unlimited source of money out of American politics by banning the parties from taking soft money.  \n\n<p />The law also banned corporations and unions from airing \u201celectioneering\u201d materials in the last 30 days before a primary, or in the last 60 days before a general election.  This would have been a way for the corporations and unions to go around the soft money ban and just channel money out of their treasuries and directly into elections.\n\n<p /><strong>Citizens United</strong> - It'll help to know that the Citizens United case involved a non-profit corporation named Citizens United.  In 2008, the group wanted to run what it called a documentary film about now Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who at the time was running for president.  The film was essentially an extended negative ad against Clinton, and so airing it would have violated the McCain-Feingold ban on \u201celectioneering\u201d communications.\n\n<p />All of this went to court.  In its Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court said McCain-Feingold ban was an unconstitutional violation of freedom of speech.\n\n<p />This cleared the path for the creation of new political funds \u2013 enter super PACs \u2013 which can take unlimited amounts from corporations or unions \u2013 and these groups could then spend very freely in elections.\n\n<p />Anyway, when McCain gets really cutting about saying \"this group\" made a movie just to challenge this, he\u2019s referring to The Citizens United group and the movie about Hillary Clinton. \n\n<p /><strong>527s</strong> - These were the super PACs of yesterday.  Only they weren't as powerful.  They were more like kindofsuper PACs.  They were non-profit-type groups that could take unlimited contributions and spend the money doing political stuff \u2013 like running commercials.  Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and Moveon.org: both 527s.\n\n<p />These groups, however, were supposed to limit their commercials and advocacy to issues.  They were supposed to stop short of saying \u201cvote for or don\u2019t vote for this guy.\u201d  So their influence was restricted in some ways.\n\n<p /><strong>Bundling</strong> \u2013 Feingold mentions this.  This is a practice that started after legal limits were placed on campaign contributions.  It really took off after McCain-Feingold put tougher limits on campaign finance.  \n\n<p />Bundlers are people who gather a bunch of smaller, limited contributions from many different donors and tie them together.  They then direct the bundle into a candidate's campaign fund, or into a party\u2019s political fund.  In a campaign environment where a 100-thousand dollar donation to a candidate is not allowed, these bundlers create really huge, but totally legitimate, pots of money that they can throw around.\n\n<p />We\u2019ve also attached a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL_461bonus_McCain_Feingold_Transcript.pdf\">transcript</a> of the full interview, for anyone interested. \n\n<p />Enjoy!"

        "description": "<p />One upshot of the recent news coverage about our show: we learned that stories by Stephen Glass were in our online archive. We'd taken these down years ago and then they went back up without any of us noting it when we did a redesign of the website in 2010.  (The people executing the new design didn't know we'd removed those shows and Ira and the radio producers on staff didn't think to inform them; they hadn't thought about those stories in years.)  \n \n<p />We're taking those shows back down again today.  \n \n<p />Stephen Glass was a reporter who fabricated stories that appeared in several national magazines. His story was the subject of the film <em>Shattered Glass</em>.  \n \n<p />In the very early days of the radio show, we had Stephen Glass (who's no relation to Ira Glass), come on the show and retell stories he'd published in magazines. This is standard practice on public radio. We trust that since we're talking to fellow journalists who already published their work in mainstream publications, the work had been edited and vetted as true. Glass wrote a story for Harper's magazine about working as a telephone psychic and then told it on our episode <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/86/how-to-take-money-from-strangers\">How to Take Money from Strangers</a>. He told a story in <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/57/delivery\">Delivery</a> about Federal Express that had appeared in The New Republic in November 1996. We sent him out with a tape recorder for a story he reported both for The New Republic and <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/79/stuck-in-the-wrong-decade\">for us</a>, about interns who played slaves at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home. We transcribed and edited the tape he recorded (this was in the early days of our program; today we have enough producers that one of us would've gone with him) and now believe that all the recorded quotes he brought back are real, while the ones he didn't manage to record are probably fabrications.  \n \n<p />As with Mike Daisey's story, we'll be pulling the audio of these stories down from our website, but will leave the transcripts up, for anyone who's interested."

        "description": "<p>Ira writes:</p>\n\n<p>I have difficult news. We've learned that Mike Daisey's story about Apple in China - which we broadcast in January - contained significant fabrications. We're retracting the story because we can\u2019t vouch for its truth.  This is not a story we commissioned.  It was an excerpt of Mike Daisey's acclaimed one-man show \"The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,\" in which he talks about visiting a factory in China that makes iPhones and other Apple products.</p>\n\n<p>The China correspondent for the public radio show Marketplace tracked down the interpreter that Daisey hired when he visited Shenzhen China.  The interpreter disputed much of what Daisey has been saying on stage and on our show. On <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction\">this week's episode</a> of <em>This American Life,</em> we will devote the entire hour to detailing the errors in \"Mr. Daisey Goes to the Apple Factory.\"</p>\n\n<p>Daisey lied to me and to <em>This American Life</em> producer Brian Reed during the fact checking we did on the story, before it was broadcast.  That doesn't excuse the fact that we never should've put this on the air.  In the end, this was our mistake. </p>\n\n<p>We're horrified to have let something like this onto public radio.  Many dedicated reporters and editors - our friends and colleagues - have worked for years to build the reputation for accuracy and integrity that the journalism on public radio enjoys.  It's trusted by so many people for good reason.  Our program adheres to the same journalistic standards as the other national shows, and in this case, we did not live up to those standards.</p>\n\n<p>A press release with more details about all this is below.  We'll be posting the audio of the program and the transcript on Friday night this week, instead of waiting till Sunday.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>This American Life Retracts Story\n<br>Says It Can't Vouch for the Truth of Mike Daisey's Monologue about Apple in China</strong></p>\n\n<p>This American Life and American Public Media\u2019s Marketplace will reveal that a story first broadcast in January on This American Life contained numerous fabrications. </p>\n \n<p>This American Life will devote its entire program this weekend to detailing the errors in the story, which was an excerpt of Mike Daisey's critically acclaimed one-man show, \"The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs.\" In it, Daisey tells how he visited a factory owned by Foxconn that manufactures iPhones and iPads in Shenzhen China. He has performed the monologue in theaters around the country; it's currently at the Public Theater in New York.  Tonight\u2019s This American Life program will include a segment from Marketplace\u2019s Rob Schmitz, and interviews with Daisey himself. Marketplace will feature a shorter version of Schmitz's report earlier in the evening.</p>\n\n<p>When the original 39-minute excerpt was broadcast on This American Life on January 6, 2012, Marketplace China Correspondent Rob Schmitz wondered about its truth. Marketplace had done a lot of reporting on Foxconn and Apple\u2019s supply chain in China in the past, and Schmitz had first-hand knowledge of the issues. He located and interviewed Daisey's Chinese interpreter Li Guifen (who goes by the name Cathy Lee professionally with westerners). She disputed much of what Daisey has been telling theater audiences since 2010 and much of what he said on the radio.</p>\n \n<p>During fact checking before the broadcast of Daisey's story, This American Life staffers asked Daisey for this interpreter's contact information. Daisey told them her real name was Anna, not Cathy as he says in his monologue, and he said that the cell phone number he had for her didn't work any more. He said he had no way to reach her.</p>\n \n<p>\"At that point, we should've killed the story,\" says Ira Glass, Executive Producer and Host of This American Life. \"But other things Daisey told us about Apple's operations in China checked out, and we saw no reason to doubt him. We didn't think that he was lying to us and to audiences about the details of his story. That was a mistake.\"</p>\n \n<p>The response to the original episode, \u201cMr. Daisey and the Apple Factory,\u201d was significant. It quickly became the single most popular podcast in This American Life\u2019s history, with 888,000 downloads (typically the number is 750,000) and 206,000 streams to date. After hearing the broadcast, listener Mark Shields started a petition calling for better working conditions for Apple's Chinese workers, and soon delivered almost a quarter-million signatures to Apple. </p>\n \n<p>The same month the episode aired, The New York Times ran a front-page investigative series about Apple's overseas manufacturing, and there were news reports about Foxconn workers threatening group suicide in a protest over their treatment. </p>\n \n<p>Faced with all this scrutiny of its manufacturing practices, Apple announced that for the first time it will allow an outside third party to audit working conditions at those factories and \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 it released a list of its suppliers. </p> \n \n<p>Mike Daisey, meanwhile, became one of the company's most visible and outspoken critics, appearing on television and giving dozens of interviews about Apple. </p>\n \n<p>Some of the falsehoods found in Daisey's monologue are small ones: the number of factories Daisey visited in China, for instance, and the number of workers he spoke with. Others are large. In his monologue he claims to have met a group of workers who were poisoned on an iPhone assembly line by a chemical called n-hexane. Apple's audits of its suppliers show that an incident like this occurred in a factory in China, but the factory wasn\u2019t located in Shenzhen, where Daisey visited. </p>\n \n<p>\"It happened nearly a thousand miles away, in a city called Suzhou,\" Marketplace\u2019s Schmitz says in his report. \"I\u2019ve interviewed these workers, so I knew the story. And when I heard Daisey\u2019s monologue on the radio, I wondered: How\u2019d they get all the way down to Shenzhen? It seemed crazy, that somehow Daisey could\u2019ve met a few of them during his trip.\"</p>\n \n<p>In Schmitz's report, he confronts Daisey and Daisey admits to fabricating these characters.</p>\n \n<p>\"I'm not going to say that I didn't take a few shortcuts in my passion to be heard,\" Daisey tells Schmitz and Glass. \"My mistake, the mistake I truly regret, is that I had it on your show as journalism, and it's not journalism. It's theater.\"</p>\n \n<p>Daisey's interpreter Cathy also disputes two of the most dramatic moments in Daisey's story: that he met underage workers at Foxconn, and that a man with a mangled hand was injured at Foxconn making iPads (and that Daisey's iPad was the first one he ever saw in operation). Daisey says in his monologue:</p>\n \n<p><blockquote>He's never actually seen one on, this thing that took his hand. I turn it on, unlock the screen, and pass it to him. He takes it. The icons flare into view, and he strokes the screen with his ruined hand, and the icons slide back and forth. And he says something to Cathy, and Cathy says, \"he says it's a kind of magic.\"</blockquote></p>\n\n<p>Cathy Lee tells Schmitz that nothing of the sort occurred.</p>\n \n<p>\"In our original broadcast, we fact checked all the things that Daisey said about Apple's operations in China,\" says Glass, \"and those parts of his story were true, except for the underage workers, who are rare. We reported that discrepancy in the original show. But with this week\u2019s broadcast, we're letting the audience know that too many of the details about the people he says he met are in dispute for us to stand by the story. I suspect that many things that Mike Daisey claims to have experienced personally did not actually happen, but listeners can judge for themselves.\"</p>\n \n<p>\"It was completely wrong for me to have it on your show,\" Daisey tells Glass on the program, \"and that's something I deeply regret.\" He also expressed his regret to \"the people who are listening, the audience of This American Life, who know that it is a journalism enterprise, if they feel betrayed.\"</p>\n \n<p>This American Life and its home station WBEZ Chicago had been planning a live presentation of Daisey's monologue on stage at the Chicago Theatre on April 7th, with Glass leading a Q&A afterwards. That show will be cancelled and all tickets will be refunded. </p>\n\n \n<p>This American Life episode will air on WBEZ at 8pm EST/7pm CST tonight and will also be available to stream and download on thisamericanlife.org at that time. It can be heard on public radio stations around the country this weekend. </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>For media inquiries for This American Life, please contact Emily Condon at This American Life: emily@thislife.org </p>\n\n<p>For listener comments to This American Life: web@thislife.org </p>\n\n<p>For media inquiries directed to Marketplace, please contact Bill Gray at American Public Media: 651-734-8239</p>\n \n<p>This American Life is produced by WBEZ Chicago and distributed by Public Radio International. </p>"

        "description": "Last March 25th, we broadcast a story, \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/430/very-tough-love\">Very Tough Love</a>\" about the drug court in Glynn County, Georgia that was run by Judge Amanda Williams. Ira interviewed a number of people who\u2019d faced Judge Williams; most memorable was a young woman named Lindsey Dills.  Lindsey forged two checks on her father's checking account for $100 total. She ended up in drug court for five and a half years; 14 months of that was behind bars, including an \"indefinite sentence\" in solitary confinement, where Judge Williams apparently sent her away with no end date named, prohibiting her from contacting anyone, including her family, her doctor, or her lawyer. She told Ira:\n<blockquote>I was like, \"How is this happening? How is this ethical? Where am I? Like am I in a foreign country? Have I killed someone that I don't know about?\" Like, \"How does what I did merit that type of treatment?\" But there's nothing I can do about it. Because I can't even use the phone. I can't even send a letter. I'm like, \"Where do they do this?\" I've never heard of it and if it's even legal.</blockquote>\nLindsey had been on anti-depressants, which were approved by the court. While in solitary confinement, she says, she ran out.  Isolated and alone, as Christmas neared, she snuck a razor and slit her wrists. Again, Lindsey: \n<blockquote>\"I actually hoped that I would die. But at the point that I figured then, well if I die, great. If I don't, at least someone will freakin' hear me. They'll have to send me somewhere. You know what I mean? They'll have get me some type of help.\"</blockquote>\nIn November of last year, Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission filed formal charges against Judge Amanda Williams. The first count consisted of 14 charges relating to Lindsey Dills' case and specifically cited her indefinite detention. Read the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Formal_Charges_Judge_Williams.pdf\">full document here</a>. In press coverage about Judge Williams, Lindsey's case was frequently cited.\n\n<p />On January 2nd of this year, Judge Williams resigned after 21 years on the bench. In a consent order, she agreed not to seek other judicial offices. \n\n<p />Then, on February 22nd, Glynn County Magistrate Timothy Barton signed an order that released Lindsey Dills from her probation and expunged her forgery convictions from her record. She would've served four more years of probation.\n\n<p />Last week, <em>The Florida Times-Union</em> caught up with Lindsey Dills. <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2012-03-01/story/new-life-woman-middle-former-glynn-judges-ethics-case\">Here\u2019s an update</a> on how she\u2019s doing. She's a new mom and happy and drug-free.\n\n<p />Ira says: \"Before I found Lindsey, I was in a situation where people would tell me things Judge Williams had done to them, but they wouldn't go on the record. Lindsey was still incarcerated at the time. Her family warned her that there could be repercussions if she spoke to me. But she spoke anyway. It was brave and I was grateful. I think it's because of her that the radio story made such an impression, around the country and especially in Georgia, where a number of well-known lawyers including a former state Supreme Court Justice became involved in the investigation of Judge Williams. I'm really glad to hear the news about her probation. I'm really glad for Lindsey. After Judge Williams stepped down I contacted Lindsey and she told me she was barely following the news. She didn't seem to think she played much of a part in this. Which, I thought, was way better than if she'd been obsessively watching every twist and turn and newsbreak. I'm glad for that too, that she was able to walk away from this bad moment in her life.\""

        "description": "<p />Ira writes:  \n\n<p />A few months ago I saw Mike Daisey perform his one man show about Apple computers and liked it so much that midway through the show I started editing a radio version in my head.  I just admired the hell out of it, out of the fact that Daisey could take a fact that we all know, that products we love are made in less-than-wonderful conditions in China, and figured out a way to construct a story so we'd actually feel something about that fact.  It's cunning, the way he pulls us in step by step.  \n\n<p />Five days after the episode aired, Apple announced it would allow outside inspectors check on conditions in suppliers' factories.  In the weeks since, a <em>This American Life</em> listener organized a petition drive that delivered 250,000 signatures to Apple asking it to improve work conditions in its Chinese plants.  \n\n<p />Daisey has never performed his show in Chicago, and I thought it would be fun to let our Chicago listeners see the show.  If you're reading this and you heard Mike on the radio, there's an entire storyline you still haven't heard: a great one, about the life of Steve Jobs.  \n\n<p />Also: it's different seeing Daisey perform the show from the radio-sized version you heard.  The stage show is just more ... epic.  As befits something on stage.  There's a grandness to it that's not right for radio, and that bigness was one of the things I enjoyed so much when I saw the show.\n\n<p />You just get one chance at this.  The show is one day only.  I'll introduce Daisey and do a Q&A afterwards.  It's a WBEZ event April 7th at the Chicago Theatre.  For tickets - and they're selling briskly, half are gone - go to <a href=\"http://thechicagotheatre.com\">thechicagotheatre.com</a>.\n<hr>\n\n<p />Original show announcement:\n\n<p /><h3><strong>Live in Chicago!<br />\nMike Daisey performing <br />\n<em>The Agony and The Ecstasy of Steve Jobs</em><br />\nDirected by Jean-Michele Gregory<br />\n with intro and Q & A by Ira Glass<br>\nSaturday, April 7</strong>\n</h3>\n\n<p>We here at This American Life proudly announce that we're presenting, along with our colleagues at WBEZ, the Chicago premiere of Mike Daisey performing <a href=\"http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com/p/monologues.html\"><em>The Agony and The Ecstasy of Steve Jobs</em></a>. On Saturday, April 7th, Mike will deliver a special, one-night-only performance at the lovely, historic <a href=\"http://www.thechicagotheatre.com/events/2012/mike-daisey-with-ira-glass-at-the-chicago-theatre.html\">Chicago Theatre</a>. Ira will be there to introduce the show and do a Q & A with Mike afterward.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0700485BBE328687?artistid=1702056&majorcatid=10005&minorcatid=104\"><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/TAL_-Agony-and-Ecstasy-photo-_Mike-Daisey_0.jpg\" alt=\"Mike Daisey\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The details:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Saturday, April 7 at 7pm at The Chicago Theatre</p>\n\n<p>\nYou can buy tickets at The Chicago Theatre box office, or go to <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0700485BBE328687?artistid=1702056&majorcatid=10005&minorcatid=104\">Ticketmaster</a><br />\nTickets range from $20-$40<br />\nEach ticket also has a $3 theatre restoration fee<br />\n<em>Please note:</em> Ticketmaster fees mean that the tickets are around 25-30% more expensive if you buy them online, so a $43 ticket is $57.13. However, tickets can be bought at face value at the Chicago Theatre box office. Visit their <a href=\"http://www.thechicagotheatre.com/about/general-info.html\">site</a> for hours and details.</p>\n\n<p>Ira saw the show during its debut run at The Public Theatre last fall, and immediately wanted to adapt it for radio. On January 6, we ran \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory\">Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory</a>,\" which included a 40-minute excerpt from this show, tailored and performed specifically for broadcast. Almost instantly, it became one of our most popular shows.</p>\n\n<p>Ira says, \"Mike's full show is a very different experience from what we put on the radio. For starters, there's an entire story line about Steve Jobs that we didn't touch. Add to that the pleasure of seeing Mike joke and sweat and spin this amazing tale in person\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI loved this when I saw it on stage and I'm so excited to bring it to Chicago.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the show:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Created and performed by Daisey and directed by Jean-Michele Gregory, this hilarious and harrowing tale finds Daisey turning his razor-sharp wit to America's most mysterious technology icon. A tale of pride, beauty, lust, and industrial design, the show illuminates how the former CEO of Apple and his obsessions shape our lives, while following the trail all the way to China to investigate the factories where millions toil to make iPhones and iPods. His dangerous journey shines a light on our love affair with our devices and the human cost of creating them.</p>\n\n<p>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak told <em>The New York Times</em>, \"I will never be the same after seeing that show.\" <em>The Washington Post</em> heralded it as \"the best original American play this year.\" <em>The AP</em> called it \"mesmerizing.\"</p>\n\n<p>Within hours of its release, \"Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory\" broke the record for our most downloaded episode. After hearing the broadcast, a listener, Mark Shields, was moved to start a petition calling for better working conditions, and soon delivered almost a quarter-million signatures to Apple. A week after the broadcast, Apple released its list of suppliers for the first time ever. In another first, the company also announced that it will start allowing an outside third party to check on working conditions at those factories, and to make its findings public. Twenty days after the broadcast, <em>The New York Times</em> ran a massive, front-page investigative report about Apple's overseas manufacturing. A month and a half after the broadcast, Foxconn, the company that Daisey visited and chronicles in his show, announced a 25% salary increase for many workers. <em>The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs</em> has reached a critical mass, and we're proud to be bringing it live to Chicago.</p>"

Drug courts were set up to emphasize rehabilitation instead of incarceration, but Glass\u2019 investigation revealed that Judge Amanda Williams strayed far from the principles and philosophy by routinely piling on jail sentences for relapses. One 17-year-old girl, initially in trouble for forging two small checks on her father\u2019s account, was facing more than 10 years in jail. Following the airing of \"Very Tough Love,\" Georgia\u2019s Judicial Qualifying Commission filed 14 ethical misconduct charges against Williams. Within weeks of the filing of charges, Williams stepped down from the bench and agreed never to seek other judicial offices.\n</blockquote>\n<p />The Polk Awards, which place a premium on investigative reporting, were established in 1949 by LIU in honor of George Polk, a CBS correspondent who was killed in 1948 while covering the Greek civil war."

        "description": "<p />\nOn <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/456/reap-what-you-sow?act=1\">last week's show</a>, we took up the subject of \"self-deportation,\" the new, supposedly gentler anti-illegal immigration movement that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been embraced by various Republican presidential hopefuls, including Mitt Romney.  In our report we credited Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach with inventing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153self-deportation.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n\n<p />\nBut we were reminded by a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/DanielDPortado\">twitter feed</a> that he was not the first person to come up with this idea.\n \n<p />\nIn fact, the concept can be traced to the mid-1990's. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when a group called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hispanics Against Liberal Takeover\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (HALTO) started running tongue-in-cheek political ads in California, calling for the self-deportation of all illegal immigrants in the United States.  \n \n<p />\nAt the time, the founder of HALTO, a Mexican-American called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/DanielDPortado\">Daniel D. Portado</a>, came onto our very own radio show in <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/41/politics?act=2\">November 1996</a>  to promote this idea. \n \n<p />\n<blockquote><strong>Daniel D. Portado</strong>: We feel that the immigrants are taking too many jobs, are bringing down the quality of life. They're not allowing our young American teenagers the character-building experiences of picking fruit and cleaning hotel beds.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p />   \nLater Ira asks him:\n \n<blockquote>\n<p />\n<strong>Ira Glass</strong>: Daniel D. Portado, if you actually believe in deportation, what are you, yourself, still doing in California?\n\n<p />\n<strong>Daniel D. Portado</strong>: Well, I am here to help everyone get out. I hope to look forward to the day where I will stand at the border and say, will the last Mexican out of California please turn out the lights? That will be me.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p />\nMr. Portado has been trying to set the record straight lately, in interviews like <a href=\"http://www.newstaco.com/2012/01/30/daniel-d-portado-the-original-self-deportationist/\">this</a>, but to little avail.\n\n<p />\nMr. Portado told Ira he got the idea for his self-deportation movement when he read about Mexican-Americans who were in favor of Propostion 187, a ballot initiative in California that prohibited illegal immigrants from using public health care, public education, and other social services in the state. \n \n <p />\nCoincidentally, Mr. Kobach told us that Proposition 187 is also what got him interested in immigration reform, which ultimately led to his idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attrition through enforcement,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d aka self-deportation.\n  \n<p />\nLuckily for Mr. Portado, his ads claim to have trademarked the term.\n\n<p />HALTO and Daniel D. Portado are reportedly the creations of political cartoonist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/laloalcaraz\">Lalo Alcaraz</a>."

        "description": "<p />\n<strong>3/16/2012 UPDATE: <em>This American Life</em> has retracted the story referenced below because we learned that many of Mike Daisey's experiences in China were fabricated. We produced an entire <a href=\"http://tal.fm/460\">new episode</a> about the retraction.</strong>\n\n<p />Producer Brian Reed writes:\n\n<p />There's news from Apple today, relating to some of the issues discussed in our program last week <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d</a>\n\n<p />For the first time, Apple has released a <a href=\"http://images.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/pdf/Apple_Supplier_List_2011.pdf\">list of companies</a> that build its products around the world. In another first, the company also announced that it will allow an independent third party to check on working conditions at those factories, and to make its findings public. \n\n<p />We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that our show inspired these moves from Apple, but both of the changes are things that Mike Daisey called for in Act Two of our episode. \n\n<p />Apple announced these changes today when it released its latest <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/reports.html\">Supplier Responsibility Progress Report</a>, which the company has published every year since 2007. In the past, the reports have typically come out in February. \n\n<p />The organization that will oversee independent audits of Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assemblers is a nonprofit called the <a href=\"http://www.fairlabor.org/fla/go.asp?u=/pub/mp&Page=WWD\">Fair Labor Association</a>, which already checks on suppliers for other American companies, including Nike, New Balance, and Adidas. Apple is the first technology company to work with the FLA. Apple says it will \"open its supply chain\" to the FLA, who will do unannounced factory visits. It will do these without coordinating with Apple, and will then post the results on its website.\n\n<p />\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a level of transparency and independent oversight that is unmatched in our industry,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Apple wrote in its progress report.\n\n<p />That said, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually what Mike was asking for at the end of our show. While Apple is listing the names of its suppliers, it still does not identify which facilities it found to have work standard violations.\n \n<p />It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear that Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partnership with the FLA will increase transparency in this regard either. The FLA will audit 5% of the factories that make Apple products, but like Apple, it will not name which ones it checks or where it finds violations. The president and CEO of the FLA, Auret van Heerden, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available to talk to me today about why this is, though it's standard practice for the FLA with all the companies it investigates.\n \n<p />I ran all this by Mike Daisey, and here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what he had to say:\n \n<p /><blockquote>Apple has released a list of its suppliers, but it still hides the companies it audited with anonymity. This makes it impossible to learn anything new about what is going on in Apple's supply chain, to verify anything, or hold anyone responsible. The FLA will audit a tiny percentage of Apple's factories, and also won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make public which factories they audit.\n\n<p />If Apple would spend less energy finessing its public image, and instead apply its efforts to real transparency and accountability, it could be a true leader for the electronics industry. Apple today is still saying what it said yesterday: trust us, we know best, there's nothing to worry about. They have not earned the trust they are asking for.</blockquote> \n\n<p />Some people are saying that what Apple is doing is still a big move. Keith Wagstaff, who covers tech for Time, <a href=\"http://techland.time.com/2012/01/13/apple-reveals-list-of-suppliers-for-the-first-time/\">writes</a> that at least now reporters can do their own investigations on factories that make Apple products. \n \n<p />\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost certain that Apple will face increased scrutiny if stories of worker suicides and other labor issues start surfacing about other factories where Apple parts are made,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d he writes.\n\n<p />Although the Fair Labor Association will not name the suppliers it assesses, its reports on the 5% of Apple facilities that it will audit will provide independent verification for the first time of Apple's claims about its supply chain. The audits posted by the FLA on its website are impressive and revealing, citing dangerous working conditions, attempts by suppliers to quash unions, unfairness in wages and hiring and much more. Go to its <a href=\"http://www.fairlabor.org/fla/go.asp?u=/pub/zTr4\">tracking charts page</a>, pick a company like Adidas or Eddie Bauer or Nike and you find what seem like frank and detailed assessments.  \n\n<p />Following up on a few other things we reported last week:\n\n<p /><blockquote>Apple conducted nearly twice as many audits in 2011 as they did in 2010.\n\n<p />They found fewer instances of child labor than in 2010: It was 91 cases in 2010 vs. 19 in 2011.\n\n<p />In our show last week we noted that in 2010, Apple found that only 32% of the suppliers it audited followed its rules about excessive working hours. According to the new report, in 2011 things did not get much better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 38% of facilities followed the rules. 37 facilities lacked basic systems to make sure that workers took off at least one day out of seven. In the report, Apple says that the problem of excessive working hours \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been a challenge throughout the history of our program. While this problem is not unique to Apple, we continue to fight it.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n \n<p />The report goes on to say that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reducing excessive overtime is a top priority for our supplier responsibility program in 2012.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d But again, Apple doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say which facilities were in violation of these rules.</blockquote>\n \n<p />Like they did when we invited them on last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show, Apple declined to talk us on the record about this news, or to respond to Mike Daisey.\n\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/reports.html\">Apple Responsibility Reports</a>\n<p /><a href=\"http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1307986\">Email that Apple CEO sent to employees about the news</a> \n<p /><a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apple-joins-fair-labor-association-137285303.html\">\nFair Labor Organization press release</a>\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/14/technology/apple-releases-list-of-its-suppliers-for-the-first-time.html\">New York Times coverage</a>\n<p /><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-13/apple-opens-partners-doors-to-labor-group-lists-suppliers.html\">Business Week coverage</a>"

He had been so good at having lunch, made such great recommendations about what to eat from the menu, and in his initial email he had even begun by writing, \"I'm Ira Glass. I host the public radio show <em>This American Life</em>\" as though he needed an introduction, which is both humble and charming.\n\n<p />But it was far from easy.\n\n<p />The stage monologue of Agony/Ecstasy is two hours long, so first we had to decide what path to take through the material. Fairly quickly we narrowed in on the China storyline\u00e2\u20ac\u201din the stage monologue the story of my journey to China is intercut with the story of Steve Jobs' rise and fall and rise at Apple, and how transformations in how we view the world make change possible. Mr. Jobs' storyline hit the cutting room floor.\n\n<p />What we cut is also often the lighter, funnier part of the show, and this was a huge challenge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhow to preserve the tone of the monologue, which uses humor and tragedy right up against one another, in such a constrained space. We were very concerned about this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwe'd review the ideas about what to keep and what to cut, and a lot of our back and forth was about keeping the lightness in the piece, so that the horrors of the facts of Foxconn and the other factories do not rise up and consume the audience, making it impossible for them to listen. In the theater we call it a Brechtian technique\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto use humor not to anesthetize, but as a tool for deepening connections, so that an audience will hear things deeply that they might not normally be willing to listen to.\n\n<p />My theatrical performances are very large\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI have been compared to Zero Mostel, Jackie Gleason, and Bill Hicks in reviews, and I often perform before hundreds of people at a time. Radio, on the other hand, is fundamentally a communion instead of a performance\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is the one speaking to the one, a voice going out into space to reach one person's ears. It is so wildly different performatively that I was afraid if I shrank down the performance I would lose the essential rhythms and tones the piece is made of, and from TAL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side they were afraid the performance would be too big and not connect with radio listeners.\n\n<p />The hybrid form we cooked up was an experiment that they had never tried at TAL before: we would adapt sections of the monologue, and then I would perform them for the radio\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but with a tiny audience there to watch.\n\n<p />By making it a recording session with an audience we had the best and worst of both worlds. On the positive side, we had a tiny room with people listening intently, so there would be live energy and laughter, but the intensity of a performance given for the radio and the radio alone. Negatively, it is an incredibly naked thing to perform without your stage presence\u00e2\u20ac\u201dto perform as nakedly as you can into a microphone, in front of an audience, and know that the people in the room can see inside of you as you do it. I found it incredibly painful and simultaneously liberating\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI've rarely learned as much in a single evening as I did during our two back-to-back tapings of the monologue.\n\n<p />There is also the matter of my language. I speak onstage with unrestricted language, or as the Puritans like to say, curse words. I use profanity to punctuate, to turn on a dime in tone and tenor\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essential. So a lot of thought went into stripping out profanity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just changing the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shit\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crap\u00e2\u20ac\u009d so there wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a BEEP, but rather figuring out when the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fuck\u00e2\u20ac\u009d should remain, knowing it would be covered by a BEEP, and trying to compose the sentence so that the BEEP worked well\u00e2\u20ac\u201dif one is going to be censored (which is exactly what this is, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be clear), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to control the context, so that you can extract the best results from the BEEP placement. \n\n<p />And sometimes the language of the piece was just wrong for the radio, even after I adjusted my performance. The theatrical show ends with a scene where I speak directly with the audience in very direct terms about what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen, and what it could mean for all of us. Onstage it works really well\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve performed it hundreds of times for many thousands of people\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut when we listened to the radio version, it just felt too grand. We tried re-cutting it to achieve something, but that only made it feel truncated. The fact is that the language worked because it played with the scale and aliveness of the theater. In the incredible intimacy of the radio, it would never achieve that\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit just sounded wrong. We ended up cutting it, and ending with a very intimate scene, because I felt like it left us somewhere very open: a meeting between two fundamentally middle-class people from very different worlds, both feeling overwhelmed by the size and scale of the world around us.\n\n<p />Paul Valery said a poem is never completed\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit is only abandoned. I am used to this sentiment, as I work in the theater where we begin again every night from zero, from the darkness, and tell the whole story anew. I found it surprising and inspiring how strongly everyone at TAL embodies this sentiment\u00e2\u20ac\u201dI've never worked with artists in another medium who believe this as much as I do. They edited right down to the wire, tweaking and evaluating, checking and rechecking, until minutes before the final deadline, which is amazingly close to when several radio stations transmit the show on Friday nights. If you want radio that tastes like theater, remember the next time you listen to the TAL livestream that the show was probably being worked on even an hour earlier.\n\n<p />I'm really glad we did this. Listening to the piece alone in my empty apartment with the lights off was a surreal experience I will never forget. It is a strange thing to go from being the speaker to the listener, and to hear your voice come back to you, like a visitor from another country, with a story you have told yourself night after night for years. The voice in the show is mine. It is me speaking for the radio, and I am so glad we worked together to find that voice."

The ship that Ira Glass, Alex Blumberg and Wendy Dorr spent time on is called the USS John C. Stennis, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been in the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/03/world/meast/iran-u-s-/index.html\">news</a> a lot lately, after Iran <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/world/middleeast/work-as-usual-for-uss-john-c-stennis-after-warning-by-iran.html?ref=usnavy\">warned the US</a> to keep the Stennis out of the Persian Gulf. And then a few days later the Stennis was involved in <a href=\"http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/u-s-military-rescues-iranians-captured-by-pirates/?ref=usnavy\">rescuing a group of Iranians</a> who were being held hostage by Somali pirates.\n\n<p />To get a sense of the <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/206/somewhere-in-the-arabian-sea\">radio episode</a>, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transcript of a great scene aboard the Stennis. Ira is being escorted around by a public affairs officer named Lieutenant Gorrell, who steers Ira away from a talkative group of sailors, over to a serious-looking young man named Kevin. This move turned out to be a huge mistake on Lieutenant Gorrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part, as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see from this exchange between Kevin and Ira:\n\n<p /><blockquote>\n<strong>Kevin</strong> I'm just ready to go home.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> How come you chose the service?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> A court order.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> Really, court-ordered?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Yeah, that's how they do it in Texas. Instead of you going to jail, they send you to the armed service. So that's how--\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> They gave you the choice of jail or the Navy?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Yeah, or the armed service, any armed service.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> You don't have to tell me the answer to this, but what kind of trouble were you in?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Drugs.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> Drugs?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Yeah.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> How much jail would you have had to do?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Seven years.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> So how do you like it?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> It sucks. It's like a prison on water. That's what it is. I don't really like it.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira (in script)</strong> This was not, of course, what Lieutenant Gorell was hoping for from young Kevin. I asked, hoping to turn things to a more positive area, if Kevin is changing. If people grow when the courts send them out here.\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> No, because people get flown off the ship almost every month for doing drugs and all kinds of stuff. So no, it's whatever you got inside of you. That's what's going to change you. If you don't want to be changed, you ain't going to be changed.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira (in script)</strong> I could practically hear the acid eating away at Lieutenant Gorell's stomach at this answer. I wracked my brain for the most completely neutral question I can ask.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> So what do you do on your job? Like what is there to do?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> You just walk around all day. For eight hours you walk around and check spaces.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> And what are you looking for?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> Just people having sex, fights, anybody drinking, doing stuff they ain't supposed to do on the boat. Hopefully we'll get to see, but I haven't seen anything yet.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> You haven't seen anything yet?\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> No. I've been looking, though.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira (in script)</strong> I glance over and catch the expression on the lieutenant's face.\n<p />\n<strong>Ira</strong> It's actually like people are pretty well behaved on this boat.\n<p />\n<strong>Kevin</strong> No, that's not true. That's not true. I don't know who told you that, but this boat is like a love boat right now.\n<p />\n<strong>Jeff Gorell</strong> All right, you're done. If anyone ever asks you to do an interview again, say no.\n</blockquote>"

        "description": "<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/132608338724.jpg\">\n\n<p />Producer Brian Reed writes:\n\n<p />After our episode <a href=\"http://tal.fm/454\">\"Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory\"</a> aired this weekend, reports started coming out about a worker standoff at a Foxconn factory in Wuhan, China. Foxconn manufactures products for Apple and many other electronics brands, and in our episode Mike Daisey tells stories he heard from the workers he talked to outside the gates of a different Foxconn plant, in Shenzhen. \n\n<p />According to news accounts, last week about 150 workers in Wuhan went to the roof of the Foxconn building for two days and threatened to commit mass suicide. Some <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/01/foxconn-still-hard-place-work/47193/\">reports</a> put the number of employees at 300.They were upset because the company had moved them to a different production line. \n\n<p />\"We were put to work without any training, and paid piecemeal,\" UK paper <em><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9006988/Mass-suicide-protest-at-China-Foxconn-factory.html\">The Telegraph</a></em> quotes one worker as saying, anonymously. \"The assembly line ran very fast and after just one morning we all had blisters and the skin on our hand was black. The factory was also really choked with dust and no one could bear it.\"\n\n<p />According to the <em>Telegraph</em> report, the employees were being moved to a new line manufacturing computer cases for Acer. The article goes on:\n\n<p /><blockquote>\"Because we could not cope, we went on strike,\" said the worker. \"It  was not about the money but because we felt we had no options. At first, the  managers said anyone who wanted to quit could have one month's pay as  compensation, but then they withdrew that offer. So we went to the roof and threatened a mass suicide.\"</blockquote>\n\n<p />Foxconn has a history of workers jumping off its buildings. When Mike Daisey was in China in 2010, Foxconn made international news over the course of several months as about a dozen workers jumped off the Shenzhen plant individually and killed themselves. One of Foxconn's responses was to put up large nets around its buildings.\n\n<p />We reached out to Foxconn about the suicide threat last week, and the company said that early in the morning on January 4th, about 150 employees staged a \"workplace incident\" at the Wuhan plant after Foxconn told them they would be transferred from one production unit to another. Foxconn sent us the following statement:\n\n<p /><blockquote>The incident was successfully and peacefully resolved later that morning after discussions between the workers, local Foxconn officials and representatives from the local government, including the labor department.  As part of the agreement between Foxconn and the employees in question, 45 of those employees chose to resign from the company under the terms of a voluntary resignation agreement and the remaining employees chose to remain as Foxconn employees.  The welfare of our employees is our top priority and we are committed to ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and that their rights are fully protected.  The operational changes that were the basis for this incident are being carried out in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations.</blockquote>\n\n<p />This is actually the first time Foxconn has responded to us. We asked the company repeatedly to comment on Mike Daisey's findings, both on and off the record, and each time they either declined or didn't get back to us.\n\n<p /><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/132608331425.jpg\">\n\n<p />Photos: club.china.com\n\n<p />More photos of the protest <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/247812/foxconn_workers_stage_protest_in_chinese_city.html\">here</a>, which are fascinating (though a warning: one of the photo sites requires login and the other has some mildly NSFW ads)."

Because she's stepping down, ethics charges brought against her by the state's Judicial Qualifications Commission will be dropped.\n\n<p />Earlier this month, the Commission added two charges to the original 12 counts it filed in November.  One of those counts accused Judge Williams of allowing her lawyer in the case, John Ossick, to represent litigants in cases she was still presiding over from the bench without disclosing their attorney-client relationship on the court record. The other accused her of putting a man into drug court even though there were no drug charges against him, because he was the nephew of attorney Jim Bishop.  When a drug court staffer questioned the decision, according to the charges, Judge Williams replied \"Jim Bishop has been there for me for years and years and years. He has never asked me for anything, ever, in the entire time I have been on the bench, to use my power in any case to do anything for anybody and he's asked me to do this. ... And it's that damn simple.\"  She also said, according to the filing: \"It's called being a Bishop. And I don't want to have any more conversations about it.

This past year we've done all sorts of ambitious, new things on the show, and I hope you liked it enough to consider pitching in a few bucks.\n\n</p><p />There were the incredibly labor intensive, full-hour investigative stories about the horrifying problems in our patent system, and about fracking, and about a Georgia Judge named Amanda Williams (who by the way has stepped down from the drug court bench and is set to go to trial in January for many of the things we discovered and reported). \n\n</p><p />Also, there was the amazingly fun hour we did at amusement parks, the Incredible Case of the PI Moms, and the show we did at the request of a 14 year old, all about middle school. And many more.\n\n</p><p />All of this takes people and money to produce. It costs our home station WBEZ $120,000 just to pay for the bandwidth to get these shows to you over the Internet.  If you are listening and not donating you are costing WBEZ money. \n\n</p><p />It used to be, I'd come on the show for four weeks in a row in December, asking for donations. This year, to cut down on the interruptions, we're trying a thing where we only ask for one week. This is that week. But for it to work, I need you to donate now, either <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=5741&amp;5741.donation=form1\">here on the web</a> or via text. If you text the letters TAL to the number 25383, and a $10 donation will be added to your phone bill (message and data rates may apply). \n\n</p><p />People sometimes ask me if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frustrating, having to request donations directly from listeners. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fairest way to fund anything: the people who like these stories and want them to exist, we pitch in a few bucks. I hope you like them enough to <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=5741&amp;5741.donation=form1\">pitch in</a>.\n\n</p><p />Thank you,\n<br />Ira Glass\n\n\n\n</p>"

At first he declined our request by phone, so my producer Brian Reed and I went to the Chilmark police station to try and convince him in person. We wanted to hear from the last person to see Tom alive. \n\n</p><p />But when we showed up, Day responded by simply fixing us with an inscrutable gaze. Maybe the dead eyes came with the territory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all, this turkey had attacked Officer Day so viciously that he felt compelled to pump it full of lead. The slaying might have left quite a mark on the policeman. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is it that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like talking about the incident?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d we asked. Day shrugged.\n\n</p><p />Honestly, we were surprised. We thought people might be able to laugh about a turkey encounter three years after it happened. We asked Officer Day if any ongoing legal issues prevented him from speaking to us. A firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and a good old eyeballing was all that Day would muster. We appealed to his sense of compassion (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brian drove through the snow from New York... I flew here from London\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), his vanity (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153people loved how you took down that bird\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), even his common sense (\"more than two million people will hear this, and your side won't be represented\"). But it was like trying to get a rise out of a meatball sandwich. Day was unflappable. \n\n</p><p />\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you not like reporters?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Another shrug. This one seemed to indicate that, yes, Day was not a committed fan of journalists. But still, some other principle was at play that Day just would not tell us.\n\n</p><p />In mafia culture, breaking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0\">Omert\u00c3\u00a0</a> can be punishable by death. Was something similar at play here, in relation to the turkey? Many people we spoke to about Tom took some time to open up about the memories of the bird. It seemed that, even in death, Tom the turkey maintained a stranglehold on some parts of the community. Certainly, most were reluctant to publicly take sides on the shooting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a small island, after all. But Officer Day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stonewalling was something new. His commitment to silence was almost impressive. Brian pleaded with him: \"If people don't want to talk, we like to tell our listeners a reason why. Are you able to give us that?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \n\n</p><p />\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said the officer. Perhaps Day just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to speak ill of the dead.\n\n</p><p /><em>Pictured: Tom the Turkey and his gang (we're not sure exactly which one is Tom).

For the last two years Ira Glass and our producer Alissa Shipp have been working with Mike to produce the film. \n\n</p><p />\nThe official synopsis:<br />\n<em>Reluctant to confront his fears of love, honesty, and growing up, a budding standup comedian has both a hilarious and intense struggle with sleepwalking.</em>\n\n</p><p />Mike's story originally came to us from <a href=\"http://www.themoth.org\">The Moth</a>, and aired in our 2008 episode <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/361/fear-of-sleep\">Fear of Sleep</a>. Then Mike adapted it into a <a href=\"http://sleepwalkwithmike.com/\">one man show</a>, and later a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439157995/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thiamelif-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1439157995\">book</a>. Mike directed the movie, and wrote it with Seth Barrish (who directed the stage version), Joe Birbiglia and Ira Glass. The film stars Mike, Lauren Ambrose, Jim Rebhorn and Carol Kane. It was shot by cinematographer Adam Beckman, who also shot our television show. Jacob Jaffke produced. \n\n</p><p />Congrats to Mike and all involved in this project. Wish us luck in Park City!\n\n</p><p /><em>Pictured: a bloodied Mike Birbiglia collects himself after a sleepwalking injury outside La Quinta Inn.</em>\n\n</p>"

Did she face any consequences for the things we documented on our program?\n\n</p><p />Yesterday, Georgia's Judicial Qualifications Commission filed formal charges against her.  The twelve counts include a number of things reported in our episode: sending away inmates for indefinite detention, jailing Charlie McCullough for 14 days for exercising his right to contest a drug screen, and using \"rude, abusive, or insulting language\" with individuals appearing before her.  \n\n</p><p />The JQC also accuses Judge Williams of sending Lindsey Dills into solitary confinement for an indefinite period, without the ability to consult with a lawyer, despite the fact that the court knew her history of suicide attempts.  (She later attempted suicide while in solitary custody.)  It accuses Judge Williams of issuing this order from her chambers, without the public or a court reporter present.   Judge Williams told the JQC that she had not issued this order, but the investigators apparently found a recording of her returning to her courtroom and declaring: \"On Lindsey Dills, she is not to have any telephone privileges and no one is to contact or visit her except [drug court counselor] Gail Kelly! Nobody! Total restriction!\"\n\n</p><p />Generally what happens in these cases is that the judge is shown the charges and given the option to step down, rather than face them.  Judge Williams apparently chose not to step down, so charges were filed.  If this proceeds to a trial, it will happen in January.\n\n</p><p />These are just accusations of course, not findings of guilt.  Judge Williams has not responded to reporters' inquiries yet about the charges.\n\n</p><p /><a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/chief-judge-from-brunswick-1221567.html\">News coverage</a> about the charges.

Check out <a href=\"http://snapjudgment.org/beating-las-vegas\">Beating Las Vegas</a> or <a href=\"http://snapjudgment.org/dwb-dancing-while-black-0\">Dancing While Black</a>  or <a href=\"http://snapjudgment.org/evil-d\">Evil D</a>.  \n\n</p><p />I mention this today because Snap Judgment puts on a hell of a live show and they have one coming up <a href=\"http://www.shakespearetheatre.org/plays/details.aspx?id=331&source=l\">in DC on November 12th</a>, with a great band adding music to the stories in real time (<a href=\"http://snapjudgment.org/true-confessions\">that ep</a> with Dancing While Black gives you a taste).  DC and Baltimore and Northern VA listeners, I'm talking to you.</p>"

        "description": "<p><a href=\"http://husbandstheseries.com/video/\"><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/husbands_0.jpg\" align=\"left\" /></a>\nIra writes:</p> \n\n<p />Jane Espenson's a very funny TV writer I admire. She wrote two of my favorite episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/superstar/id366916892?i=367252441\">\"Superstar\"</a> and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/i-was-made-to-love-you/id370695714?i=370843298\">\"I Was Made to Love You\"</a>, and also wrote for The O.C., Firefly, Battlestar Galactica and Gilmore Girls. For a while she had a cheery <a href=\"http://www.janeespenson.com/\">blog</a> full of practical tips and thoughts about how to write for television, including her theories on how to create funny dialogue, which was fascinating.\n\n</p><p />Anyway, she's just finished a <a href=\"http://husbandstheseries.com/video/\">new project</a>. It's a sitcom, and it follows all the rules and conventions of any sitcom, except it's about a gay married couple. As she puts it: \"Mad About You but with two guys.\" When she and her co-writer Brad Bell came up with the idea, they realized it's such an obvious concept for a series that if network TV had wanted to do it, they already would've. So instead of going around pitching the show, they made it on the cheap, with their own money, on the Internet. A sitcom veteran, Jeff Greenstein, who did about a million episodes of Will and Grace, directed.\n\n</p><p />They shot a 22-minute pilot, and split it into eleven two-minute videos, i.e., bite-sized enough to be appropriate for the web. The last bit of it just went up. It's called Husbands. The setup is decidedly old-school. Two fresh-faced guys named Brady and Cheeks get married on a drunken bender in Vegas, and then decide they'll try to make the marriage work, after briefly considering annulment:\n\n</p><p /><strong>Brady</strong> (who's a pro baseball player): Marriages can be annulled if you're too drunk to know what you're doing. My teammates do it all the time.\n\n</p><p /><strong>Cheeks</strong>: So that's why you're called The Dodgers!\n\n</p><p />Brady doesn't laugh.\n\n</p><p /><strong>Cheeks</strong>: Wrong time but it's comedy gold, trust me.\n\n</p><p /><strong>Brady</strong>: I'm not going to be the first gay divorce since the new law! We have to stay technically married for a while.\n\n</p><p /><strong>Cheeks</strong>: Straight people do this all the time! In fact, if we weren't gay, this would be a hackneyed premise.\n\n</p><p />Husbands is chock-a-block with the clever clever writing of a sitcom, delivered at the hurried pace of people trying to cram in as many jokes as humanly possible. Though if you're going to check out just one episode, make it the last one, <a href=\"http://blip.tv/husbands-the-series/husbands-11-winky-face-5653065\">number eleven</a>, where it pivots from this rat-a-tat sitcom writing to a moment where Brady suggests to Cheeks \"How about we stop talking, get into bed and find something else to do.\" And they do. They cuddle and there's a full-on, no kidding, romantic kiss. Which is somehow mindblowing in this sugar-coated, fun-for-the-family context. It is not the quick peck on the cheek that Cam and Mitchell finally got to in season two of Modern Family. Seeing a man sweetly kiss another man onscreen and not in some moodily-lit Sundance movie with an Important Statement To Make, but just another day in America's dumbest art form, the sitcom, feels new and amazing. And sure, now that I've looked it up on Google, I've learned of gay kisses on Glee and Will and Grace. It still feels new. It feels like you're peeking at a future \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of TV, of America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that's just barely coming into existence. \n\n</p><p />Jane's hope is that some brave network \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AMC? NBC? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will notice their little experiment and give them a budget larger than the cost of a Hyundai to blow people's minds on real TV. If they do it right, of course, they won't be blowing minds at all. They'll just be the New Normal.\n\n</p>"

A week ago I appeared onstage with Rachel Maddow, John Hodgman, Eugene Mirman and others, and the next morning, woke up in my own clothes, in my own bed, smelling faintly of vomit, unable to remember anything that happened onstage after the first 15 minutes, not even sure how I got home.  I'm not proud of this.  I bring it up only to say that I told the entire story onstage to Marc Maron for the <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/\">WTF podcast</a> and if you want to hear it, <a href=\" http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_213_-_artie_lange_nick_dipaolo_nick_griffin_joe_mande_wayne_koesten\">the link is here</a>. Overall, it's a pretty great episode of Marc's podcast, with Morgan Spurlock and a bunch of comedians including&mdash;astonishingly&mdash;Artie Lange.  I got to meet and sit onstage with Artie Lange! And if you don't know who he is, all I can say is, you have not listened to enough Howard Stern.  Like any Stern fan, I love Artie.  He's my favorite on that show by far.  I've seen him perform at a comedy club and at Carnegie Hall.  He has no idea who the hell I am.  Terry Gross did the definitive interviews with Artie, in <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6074606\">2006</a> and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=96849879\">2008</a>, but I guess his knowledge of public radio doesn't go far beyond <em>Fresh Air</em>.  Improbably, against an amazing lineup of comedians, the person who hits it out of the park in this WTF episode, for my money, is Elna Baker, who's been on our show a couple times.  I'm not sure this episode of WTF is as great as the very funny <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_164_-_bill_hader_fred_armisen_eric_drysdale_chuck_klosterman_sarah_\">Episode 164</a>, where the guests were Bill Hader, Fred Armisen, Eric Drysdale, Chuck Klosterman and Sarah Vowell, or the amazing <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_200_-_marc_maron_as_told_to_mike_birbiglia\">Episode 200</a>, where comedian Mike Birbiglia interviewed Marc (Mike's nice-guy demeanor helps him get away with some super tough questions like \"what happened in your divorces, anyway?\" and \"you were great when I first saw you perform and then am I mistaken or didn't you go through a stretch of mediocrity?\"), but it's a really funny episode nonetheless.</p>"

        "description": "<p />Ira writes:  \n\n</p><p />Fantastic news today as one of our colleagues and friends at Radiolab, Jad Abumrad, was named a <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.7728991/k.12E8/Meet_the_2011_Fellows.htm\">MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" winner</a>.  I couldn't agree more with whoever chooses people for those awards: Jad does amazing, beautiful, innovative work. That show sounds like nothing else on the air. And it's fun to listen to.\n\n</p><p />Coincidentally, yesterday I posted on the public radio website Transom <a href=\"http://transom.org/?p=20139\">an essay</a> talking about what makes Radiolab so great.  Transom is a site for people who want to make radio stories, so I get into the nuts and bolts of how the show is made, what they're doing to create their unusual sound and sensibility.  But I also try to place Radiolab in context with where public radio is now, and where it could go.  At one point, I talk about the chatty, informal style of narration on Radiolab, and how different it is from the tone of most public radio programs:\n\n</p><p /><blockquote>This question of tone is something lots of people in public radio have been talking about lately. A 2010 <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=25&ved=0CDAQFjAEOBQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Ffilecache.drivetheweb.com%2Fmr5%2F67292%2Fdownload%2FNPR%252BAudience%252BOpportunity%252BStudy%25E2%2580%2594Summary%252Bof%252BKey%252BTakeaways.pdf&rct=j&q=smithgeiger%20npr%20summary&ei=LstsTp-9CuPX0QGn-JGBCw&usg=AFQjCNEJNqEeSXwTiB6t_l1oWBOkhG4bkg&cad=rja\">NPR/SmithGeiger survey</a> of news consumers who rightly should be in the public radio audience, showed that one of the biggest reasons adults say they choose not to listen to public radio is that <a href=\"http://www.current.org/audience/aud1017npr-opportunities.shtml\"> they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re put off by the tone</a>. One survey respondent said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This type of story could be interesting, but the reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice and intonation is soooo affected, upper class, wasp, Ph.D. student-like, it detracts from the story. She speaks like she is writing a novel.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Radiolab has invented a sound that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put off smart people who should be in our audience. Simply put: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a show that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out for fun. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that a much younger audience loves Radiolab. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that a huge part of its fan base is people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider themselves public radio listeners.</blockquote>\n\n</p><p />If you're a fan of Radiolab like I am, I hope you check out the essay.  And if you've ever thought about making your own radio stories, for fun or profit, you should poke around on the <a href=\"http://transom.org\">Transom site<a>, where they tell you everything you could want to know, from what gear and editing software you can get on the cheap, to how to use that gear and software, to how to structure a story, with lessons and advice from the most experienced and interesting people doing radio, from the Planet Money team and the Kitchen Sisters to the late great Studs Terkel.\n\n<p />At the end of yesterday's essay about Radiolab, I wrote about how WNYC's managers have always been great supporters of the program, but they don't seem to treat Jad and his co-host Robert Krulwich as their resident geniuses.  Radiolab is not central to the station's identity, the way our show is with our home station WBEZ Chicago.  Understandably, I suppose, it's the very fine daily talk show hosts on WNYC - who log so much more time on the air - who define the identity of the radio station, not Radiolab.  \n\n</p><p />Now that the MacArthur Fellowship has officially declared Jad to be a genius, it'll be interesting to see if that changes at all.  </p></a></a></p>"

As part of this, Glass mixes stories from the show, live onstage, combining his narration with pre-taped quotes and music, recreating the sound of the show as the audience watches. And he plays funny and memorable moments from the show, and talks about what was behind their creation.</em>\n\n</p><p />Tickets links are below.

Just did a brief run through of the 8/23 update and the big issues seemed to be fixed.

And if you've been waiting to download the app, now is a good time to give it a try. It's $3 over at the <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=org.prx.talbot&hl=en\">Android Marketplace</a>. If you're not yet running 2.2 or higher, check with your carrier and phone manufacturer to see if an update is available (unfortunately it's difficult to improve stability for older versions of the operating system).\n\n</p>"

        "description": "Sarah Koenig here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been away for the past month, so am just now responding to some of the comments about the gas drilling stories I reported for the \"<a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/440/game-changer\">Game Changer</a>\" show that ran back in July. \n\n<p />First, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to correct an embarrassing error in the first half of the show, when Dan Volz from the University of Pittsburgh said one of the pollutants being dumped into water from fracking operations was \"bromium.\" We got a bunch of emails, several from chemists, pointing out that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no such thing as bromium. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one: \"I can see the professor misspeaking, but when the producer goes on to say how bromium causes cancer, there should be a little more scrutiny.\"\n\n</p><p />I agree. I emailed Dan Volz about it, and he was chagrinned. He answered: \"It was a slip-up&mdash;it is bromide&mdash;can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe I did it. Bromide in water becomes brominated compounds in finished drinking water after treatment.\" And those compounds can be bad for you. As for why I repeated the fake element of \"bromium\" in the script, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly sure. I definitely looked up bromide to see what it did to you if you ate enough of it, but then must have just trusted that if Dan Volz called it \"bromium,\" I should too. In any case, I apologize for the mistake, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m grateful listeners pointed it out. \n\n</p><p />The second thing I want to respond to is a press release that Penn State University issued after the show ran. (You can read the whole thing <a href=\"http://live.psu.edu/story/54159\">here</a>.)\n\n<blockquote>\"The recent edition of <em>This American Life</em> relied solely on the views of one person, Dr. Terry Engelder. While Dr. Engelder is a distinguished researcher, a more thorough investigation into the variety of views held by a number of faculty members would have given a more accurate picture of the scholarly debate and constructive disagreement that serves as the foundation for Penn State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s research productivity in all fields of inquiry.\"</blockquote>\n\nThis is not true. Of course I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only rely on Terry Engelder at Penn State. I talked both on the record and informally to at least a dozen faculty members about their Marcellus work&mdash;including geologists, a mining engineer, a chemist, several sociologists, a water expert&mdash;even an English professor who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning to start a humanities-based Marcellus project. I also made sure to say in the story that Penn State was not monolithic, and that there were lots of people doing all kinds of Marcellus research there. But my point was that at the beginning of the gas boom in Pennsylvania, PSU certainly looked like a booster of drilling. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reputation it quickly got. Broadcasting more interviews with other researchers wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have changed that fact. In any case, my story wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a survey of Penn State's Marcellus work, it was a look at how research universities are tied to gas drilling in the state. \n\n</p><p />The PSU press release went on to say this: \"What is most troubling is the suggestion by <em>This American Life</em> that the integrity of our research is a commodity that can be bought and sold. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The notion that we would accept a monetary donation in return for favorable research findings is insulting&mdash;baseless speculation rooted in a conspiratorial imagination.\"\n\n</p><p />This is perhaps a willful misinterpretation of what I say in the story. I never say research is bought and sold at Penn State. I did talk about the pro-industry economics report that the College of Earth and Mineral sciences put out, that was funded by the Marcellus Shale Coalition&mdash;initially without the authors acknowledging that. A report, by the way, that was criticized even by the college\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own dean, who said the researchers \"may well have crossed the line between policy analysis and policy advocacy.\" \n\n</p><p />As for the other research I mention, I never implied that it was skewed toward a certain result. Rather, I point out that funding from industry can tamp down dissent in an academic setting&mdash;which is most certainly true. For Penn State to pretend that the source of its funding has absolutely no bearing on how researchers do their work, on what they choose to investigate, or on how certain topics get publicly debated, is disingenuous at best, and dishonest at worst. \n\n\n\n\n\n</p>"

Monday night, June 20, I'm in <a href=\"http://www.symphonyspace.org/event/6815-great-speeches-other-outbursts-with-sarah-vowell\">this show</a> that seems like it's going to be kind of amazingly great, with a bunch of people from <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\"><em>The Daily Show</em></a> (John Hodgman, John Oliver, Wyatt Cenac&mdash;though come to think of it, is it really right to i.d. Hodgman as \"from <em>The Daily Show</em>\" at this point?), plus the iconically great Eric Bogosian, Bobby Cannavale and Amy Sedaris.  Oh! And <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/sarah-vowell\">Sarah Vowell</a>, who's organizing it and has us all performing famous and memorable speeches from history.  That's the event.  Plus \"outbursts\" which is Sarah's tricky way to include anything anyone thinks will be funny to perform in front of an audience.  \n\n<p />I may or may not perform a Garrison Keillor \"News from Lake Wobegon\" monologue, I can't decide.  Tried it last weekend on the stage of the Fitzgerald Theater in St Paul where they do <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>, while giving a speech there for Minnesota Public Radio, and it seemed to work with the public radio fans there, to hear his words coming out of my mouth, sounding just like me, with the music we use on our show underneath me as I talked.  But maybe that's a situation where context was everything.  Hopefully Sarah will tell me if this is a good idea or not.\n\n</p><p />Yes, it's $40 but that money goes to <a href=\"http://www.826nyc.org/\">826NYC</a> to teach kids to write and not to cocaine and imported shoes like most of the shows mentioned on this blog and yes, I'm talking to you <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\"><em>Radiolab</em></a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/birbigs\">Mike Birbiglia</a>.  \n\n</p><p />Seriously, Sarah keeps telling me all her plans for the night and I think it's going to be a special one.  \n</p>"

There've been investigative stories, like the hour about a drug court judge in Georgia, and the one where we uncovered what seems to be the original recipe for Coca-Cola. There was the show where we tried to document the previous week in the life of our country and the one where we all took the psychopath test.  \n</p>\n<p>\nAll that costs money.

Throw us a dollar, or five dollars, or ten. Cheaper than a movie!  Or if you give more, cheaper than a concert!  Cheaper than your cable bill!  Cheaper than lots of stuff you love less than you love us.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou can donate online at our <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=5741&amp;5741.donation=form1\">website</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=6665688\">Paypal</a>.

        "description": "<p /><img src=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/tapes.jpg align=\"left\" style=\"margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\" />Production manager Seth Lind writes:\n\n</p><p />A few weeks ago I was cleaning out our storage closet (yes, it's as glamorous as you imagine around here), and came across a bunch of blank cassette tapes. I remembered putting them in the closet five years earlier, so I figured we wouldn't be using them anytime soon. Rather than toss them, I tweeted out asking if any listeners still make mix tapes and wanted to take them off our hands. A surprisingly large number of people responded.\n\n</p><p />But then I got curious about what mixes people would make. So when I sent off the tapes I asked folks to also upload a digital version on <a href=\"http://www.8tracks.com/\">8tracks.com</a>, a site that lets you legally create and share mixes, so that we could put a few up here on our blog along with the stories behind them. Maybe we'll even match up some of the actual tapes with other listeners.\n\n</p><p />Here's the first one, from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/branwellington\">Jamin Hoyle</a> in Maryland. He made a mix with one song for each of his co-workers as he was leaving a job.  It has 35 songs, so I'm guessing it filled two tapes. If you're not in the mood for, say, stories on a theme, give a listen.\n\n</p><p /><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,28,0\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://8tracks.com/mixes/307174/player_v3\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed src=\"http://8tracks.com/mixes/307174/player_v3\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"300\" height=\"250\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" ></embed></object>\n\n</p><p />Jamin writes:\n\n</p><p />I just left my job as an art director at a design and advertising agency. I was only there for six busy, stormy months. I made a mixtape for the agency and gave it to them on the last day. Because that's what you do when you're wrung out and you want to say something but you can't use the real words. \n\n</p><p />I put it on the server and let everybody download it, telling them there was a song in there for all 35 people in the agency. But I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell anybody which song was whose. I just thought it would be a fun puzzle to let people try to figure it out. Plus, the whole point of saying goodbye is hoping to be remembered for a little while after you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re gone. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been afraid of being forgotten.\n\n</p><p />One of my best friends at the agency is warm and joyful and exuberant and cocksure and from the Midwest. She got Hey Nonny Nonny, not really for the lyrics but because of the way the song makes me feel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boisterous and loud but also reverential. And because Violent Femmes are from the Midwest.\n\n</p><p />A woman who worked pretty closely alongside me and did a lot of the heavy lifting got 99, which is about Agent 99 from Get Smart. \n\n</p><p />Get Me is about somebody who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t turn out to be the person I hoped or wanted he would be. \n\n</p><p />I've broken the agreed-upon conventions of mixtapes. i.e. more than one entry from the same band (and worse, more than one entry from the same album), it runs far too long, the first half is solid but becomes a bit of a mishmash after Wave of Mutilation, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a shade too much pop-punk, no Al Green.\n\n</p><p />Truth be told, I had to cheat. I got close to my quit date and realized that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to know every person in just six months. Some people didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get songs. On the other hand, I grew extremely fond of some people and they got multiple songs. And frankly, some songs are on there just because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cathartic and I like them.\n\n</p><p /><em>Leaving of Liverpool</em> - The Pogues\n<br /><em>I Don't Love Anyone</em> - Belle & Sebastian\n<br /><em>Hey Nonny Nonny</em> - Violent Femmes\n<br /><em>You Don't Know...</em> - Jawbreaker\n<br /><em>Career Opportunities</em> - The Clash\n<br /><em>Ivy League College</em> - J Church\n<br /><em>The Boy Who Sailed Around the World</em> - Go Sailor\n<br /><em>Winterlong</em> - Pixies\n<br /><em>Jamie (Live and Acoustic)</em> - Weezer\n<br /><em>Ask</em> - The Smiths\n<br /><em>Hot Guacamole</em> - MF Doom & MC Paul Barman\n<br /><em>No Culture Icons</em> - The Thermals\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \n<br /><em>Detroit Has a Skyline</em> - Superchunk\n<br /><em>99</em> - Screeching Weasel\n<br /><em>Disappearing Boy</em> - Green Day\n<br /><em>Chesterfield King</em> - Jawbreaker\n<br /><em>Get Me</em> - Dinosaur Jr\n<br /><em>Brandy Alexander</em> - Feist\n<br /><em>Wave of Mutilation (UK Surf)</em> - Pixies\n<br /><em>Burn Your Way Home</em> - Algebra One\n<br /><em>Range Life</em> - Pavement\n<br /><em>Wings of a Dove</em> - Madness\n<br /><em>Young Livers</em> - Rocket from the Crypt\n<br /><em>Dead</em> - They Might Be Giants\n<br /><em>Maggie Mae</em> - The Pietasters\n<br /><em>We Ain't Even Married</em> - Young Pioneers\n<br /><em>Cottleston Pie</em> - Rowlf the Dog\n<br /><em>Now That You Are Gone</em> - Mr. T Experience\n<br /><em>My Favorite Place</em> - J Church\n<br /><em>Fett's Vette</em> - MC Chris\n<br /><em>Cut Your Hair</em> - Pavement\n<br /><em>Please Do Not Go</em> - Violent Femmes\n<br /><em>The Slow Descent Into Alcoholism</em> - The New Pornographers\n<br /><em>My Brain Hurts</em> - Screeching Weasel\n<br /><em>Walcott</em> - Vampire Weekend\n</p>"

No more shuttling through audio to get to that one story your friend told you about. Of course, we believe that the episodes are best heard as a whole, but we understand that sometimes you're just after one particular act. So there's that.\n</p>\n\n<p>You'll also notice in the upper right corner, <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/user/login\">LOGIN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/user/register\">REGISTER</a> links. Now you can make an account on the site, which unlocks features like marking favorite episodes, checking off which episodes you've heard, and creating and saving playlists with multiple stories and episodes. Your own DASHBOARD page contains these lists.</p>\n\n<p>We'll be adding new features over time, such as playlist sharing and new ways to interact with the archive. Stay tuned.</p>\n\n<p>And as always, we value your feedback.

Big congratulations to the team over at <a href=\"http://www.prx.org\">PRX</a>, who built the app. And we'd like to thank The Academy. For real: it's the 750 members of The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences who vote on these things, apparently. And thanks to all of you who voted for us as well, for the People's Voice Award. Fandango won that, but hey, who doesn't like movies? \n\n</p><p />One request. If you use one of our apps&mdash;iPhone, iPad or Android&mdash;would you mind rating/reviewing it? It helps us know how they're working. And to be honest, reviews skew negative because people are just more inclined to speak up when something is not working. So in an effort to have the apps' reputations match their quality, we'd love it if you went to iTunes or the Android Market and gave a rating:\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=QNAY93oR8Vk&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fthis-american-life%252Fid348530331%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D6%2526partnerId%253D30\">iPhone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=QNAY93oR8Vk&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fthis-american-life-ipad%252Fid424973759%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30\">iPad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=org.prx.talbot&feature=search_result\">Android</a></li></ul>\n\n</p><p />Thank you!

There's also a <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/special/cdo-world\">comic strip</a>.\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />But while we poked fun at the ironies in this story, and by so doing tried to make it more accessible, its central point is quite serious, and critically important: that the mores of Wall Street, at least in the period 2006-2008, were not consistent with the public interest or the national interest, and that greater oversight (and perhaps enforcement actions) may be in order.

A law professor representing Judge Amanda Williams issued <a href=\"http://www.atlawblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Williams-Rebuts-Glass-Press-Release-April-14-2011.pdf\">a press release</a> yesterday saying that my story about her was \"riddled with falsehoods\" and \"libel masquerading as journalism.\" Today he publicly released the <a href=\"http://www.atlawblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Letter_to_Glass_April_8_20111.pdf\">14-page letter</a> he sent me.\n\n</p><p />For all the minutiae presented in these two documents, Judge Williams and Mr. Oedel don't dispute and barely address at all the main two points of my story or the evidence I provide to back up those points. Those two main points: \n\n</p><p />1) Judge Williams' drug court uses punitive sanctions for relapses and other broken rules which are harsher than any other drug court I&mdash;or the national experts interviewed for the show, who were familiar with hundreds of drug courts across the country&mdash;could find. These jail sanctions&mdash;3 days for a first relapse when a defendant doesn't admit he's still using, 7 days for a second relapse, 28 days for a third relapse, and \"indefinite detention\" after that&mdash;not only go against national guidelines set by the National Association for Drug Court Professionals, researchers (and the head of the NADCP) told me that studies show they would not work with addicts. They run counter to the core philosophy of drug court. \n\n</p><p />2) Judge Williams' court uses a variety of means that other drug courts don't to encourage defendants to sign up for drug court. \n\n</p><p />Although Judge Williams and Mr. Oedel claim that there's \"a litany of factual errors\" in the radio broadcast, the only errors they found were in something I posted on our website.  I corrected these once I was informed of the errors. There is no \"litany of errors.\"\n\n</p><p />My attorneys are responding to Mr. Oedel's letter with <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/Foley_response_to_Oedel_April_15_2011.pdf\">one of their own</a>. \n\n</p><p />For now, I'll confine my comments to his press release.\n\n</p><p />Mr. Oedel and Judge Williams state that \"Glass was looking for someone his  listeners could hate, and when the facts didn't fit, he just made them up to make the protagonist hateful.\" This isn't true. I made up no facts. I stumbled onto this story, and followed the facts where they led. I have no interest in making anyone seem hateful and in fact my story points out Judge Williams' idealism, her good intentions and her great success with many drug court participants. In the story, I quote one who says she saved his life. I would have liked very much to include more from the Judge's perspective, and I wrote her many letters saying this, but once she was re-elected this fall, she declined both my interview requests and my repeated requests to record in her courtroom. \n\n</p><p />Regular listeners to our radio show know that it's overwhelmingly comprised of stories where there is no one to hate. If anything, that's a hallmark of the show. Yes, when it came to the Wall Street meltdown (and my comments about our coverage, referenced by Mr. Oedel), we did at one point go looking for stories of bankers who did things that were illegal or unethical, as many journalists did. That has nothing to do with this. \n\n</p><p />In his press release, Mr. Oedel makes a number of statements that I believe are untrue. \n\n</p><p />He says my story:\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"used the recollections of three people who washed out of that treatment program to claim that Judge Williams coerced them into drug court in the first place, and imposed overly punitive (but previously agreed-upon) sentences when they washed out of drug court for driving under the influence and other relapses.\"\n\n</p><p />Well, no. In Lindsey Dills' case I go to pains to explain that she was not forced into the drug court program but insisted on it herself. In Charlie McCullough's case I explain that he gladly chose drug court. In Brandi Byrd's case, yes, I point out all the incentives Judge Williams uses that no other drug court seems to use. In their letter and press release, Mr. Oedel and Judge Williams say nothing to challenge the accuracy of the facts I included about those incentives.\n\n</p><p />As for the sentences these three got \"when they washed out of drug court\"&mdash;my story does not discuss whether those are punitive or not. That is not a subject I take up in my report.\n \n</p><p />Instead, I focus entirely on the sanctions they and other defendants get while <em>in</em> the drug court program. Here, I point out that the sanctions are much higher than those recommended as effective by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, and much higher than any drug court I could find. Nothing in Mr. Oedel's press release or letter contests these conclusions or the evidence I present for them.\n\n</p><p />Mr. Oedel says:\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"After Oedel challenged Glass on that claim of no independent judicial review, Glass retracted his allegation on April 11, 2011, admitting on Glass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website, 'That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true.'\"\n\n</p><p />There was no retraction. Mr. Oedell sent his letter. In it he said that my radio story had claimed that there was no appeals process for decisions made in Judge Williams' court. But he was misinterpreting the story. The story did not say that. As I pointed out <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/blog/2011/04/a-clarification-and-a-correction\">in my clarification</a>, there's a quote in the story where an attorney, Jim Jenkins, says that there's no procedure to appeal the sanctions the judge levies against you in drug court. If she gives you 28 days for a drug relapse, there's no procedure to compel her to review that decision. A public defender who worked in her drug court confirmed this. I stand by that as factual. I did not retract anything.\n\n</p><p />But I posted a clarification because two other listeners had asked me about the same thing, was Jenkins saying there was no appeal process at all? He wasn't, and it seemed worth clearing up. \n\n</p><p />Mr. Oedel writes:\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"This is one of the most effective drug courts in the nation, with a recidivism re-arrest rate of 5.5 percent at three years after concluding treatment.\"\n\n</p><p />This \"re-arrest rate of 5.5 percent,\" Mr. Oedel's letter makes clear, comes from a 29-page report issued by Judge Williams' drug court. As best as I can tell, in quoting this number, Mr. Oedel and Judge Williams are misreading the Judge's own report. The charts on pages 14 and 21 of the report do indeed show that graduates had a recidivism re-arrest rate of 5.5 percent for felony non-drug offenses (or perhaps this is for all felony offenses, the report isn't very clear), but when you add in the other offenses measured by the study&mdash;non-drug misdemeanors, drug misdemeanors and felony drug offenses&mdash;the recidivism re-arrest rate cited by the charts is 30.1 percent, not as impressive when compared to the national averages that Mr. Oedel quotes. \n\n</p><p />This report does not appear to be the work of an independent researcher, but generated by the drug court staff itself. The copy provided to me had not been peer reviewed or published. Using it as the one piece of evidence to conclude that \"this is one of the most effective drug courts in the nation\" seems questionable. \n\n</p><p />Mr. Oedel writes:\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"After being challenged by Oedel, Glass also conceded that he erred in reporting that bail in one of his example cases was revoked for the addict\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to pay for her drug treatment.\"\n \n</p><p />Yes that's true. After Kim Spead sat in jail for eleven months, from September 24, 2003 to August 5, 2004, Judge Williams did finally offer her bail at $15,000 cash. The word \"cash\" is handwritten and double underlined on the court document, and initialed by Judge Williams.\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"Glass admitted that the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bail was revoked for failure to report to court, not for failure to pay a portion of costs for treatment.\" \n\n</p><p />Here Mr. Oedel is correct. I misunderstood the sentencing document, which did not state what Kim Spead was being sentenced for. I appreciate the correction and was glad to update it. This was not a fact that was part of our broadcast, but a case I wrote about on our website.\n\n</p><p />Mr. Oedel writes:\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\"John Dills, the father of Lindsey Dills, the primary source relied upon by Glass for his story, flatly rejected Glass\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that the drug court program hurt his daughter.\"\n\n</p><p />Great. And if he'd been willing to talk to me in a taped interview, maybe that's something I could have quoted on the radio. But he turned me down. As to whether Judge Williams' drug court saved his daughter's life or anyone else's, it seems possible it could have saved those lives using sanctions that are more in line with national standards. In Lindsey's case, when one of the sanctions that no other drug court uses&mdash;Judge Williams' \"indeterminate sentence\"&mdash;was employed, Lindsey unsuccessfully attempted suicide. More traditional sanctions against Ms. Dills might have avoided that.\n\n</p><p />As to this:\n\n</p><P CLASS=\"indented\" />\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Glass is an admitted character assassin who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not above using his national radio platform for partisan political purposes in the national debate about drug courts, meanwhile trashing a local official whose major offense was to succeed at helping people to get off of drugs, keep off drugs, and survive.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\n</p><p />Let me state here unequivocally: I do not admit to being a character assassin. Also: I am not a character assassin. Further: I have no idea what \"partisan political purposes\" would be in the national debate over drug courts since, as I point out in my story, both major parties support drug courts. They seem like a fine idea to me as well. My story had nothing to say about the effectiveness of drug courts nationally, except to praise it. My story was about how this particular drug court, run by Judge Williams, is not run like other drug courts. Nothing in Judge Williams' and Mr. Oedel's press release and letter contradicts that.\n\n</p><p />If Judge Williams wanted to comment on what I found in my research, I wished she had answered my repeated letters and phone calls asking her to do that in my story. If she prefers to respond through press releases then I guess I'll settle for that. \n\n</p><p />So now I call on her and Mr. Oedel to answer these questions for me in their next press release: When she sentenced Charlie McCullough for his very first drug relapse to 17 days in detention and added a year and a half to his time in the drug court program, this was a much harsher sentence than recommended for a first relapse by the National Association for Drug Court Professionals. The NADCP recommends no jail time at all for a first relapse. The NADCP philosophy&mdash;articulated in my story by its president&mdash;is that more punitive sanctions don't work with addicts. Research shows that more punitive sanctions can backfire and in fact be counter-productive with addicts. Which brings me to my questions: What was the therapeutic goal of this unusually harsh sanction? Why does she believe a sanction so out of line with national standards will be effective? Since it caused Charlie McCullough to give up on the program, does she believe it backfired? Finally: now that she's been informed that the jail sanctions she imposes are far outside the national guidelines, and that research studies show that such measures may be ineffective, will she be eliminating these punitive measures which add an additional burden to taxpayers?\n\n\n</p>"

        "description": "<p />Ira writes: \n\n</p><p />In the weeks since our show <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/430/very-tough-love\">\"Very Tough Love\"</a> about Judge Amanda Williams, a few things have come to my attention that I'd like to clarify:\n\n</p><p /><strong>1.  Appeals</strong>\n\n</p><p />A few people have asked about a claim made by attorney Jim Jenkins in the story.  He says that if someone is unhappy with some sanction levied by Judge Williams in drug court \"there is no provision at all for any kind of appeal. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the other real problems with the procedures of this particular drug court. If Judge Williams sentences you to 30 days or an indeterminate sentence, there is nothing that can be done. Period. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nobody to go to.\"\n\n</p><p />To clarify what he's saying: he's saying there's no procedure to contest any particular sanction.  You can't compel Judge Williams or another judge to review your 30 day sentence for relapsing, or your indeterminate sentence.  A public defender who worked in the drug court confirmed this.  As far as I can tell, that's completely accurate.\n\n</p><p />Some listeners believed Jenkins meant something bigger:  that there was no literally no legal recourse for a defendant in that situation.  That's not true.  There aren't great options, but there are options.  A defendant who's unhappy with one of Judge Williams' sanctions can ask to be terminated from drug court.  If they do that, they'll serve the time for the crime that got them into drug court in the first place.  \n\n</p><p />And there's something called a habeas petition - where a defendant can attempt to withdraw his original guilty plea (which was a prerequisite to enter drug court) and be retried on the original charge.  In a 2004 case called State v Stinson, the Georgia Supreme Court (affirming a decision by Judge Williams) declared that a drug court defendant can't withdraw his original guilty plea and be retried, if there's no mistake or irregularity in the original plea.  So you can get a new trial only in very specialized circumstances.  Something had to be wrong with your original plea.  For instance, Charlie McCullough, who was in our radio story, eventually was released on a habeas petition.  As his lawyer explained to me, this was possible because Charlie's original guilty plea was for the crime of attempting to purchase ecstasy (this is what he was charged with when he got into court) but in fact he'd tried to purchase LSD, not ecstasy.\n\n</p><p />You can also file a habeas on a Constitutional defect.  The most common is ineffective assistance of counsel. Charlie relied on that in his habeas petition as well.\n\n</p><p />Other longshot appeals?  If Judge Williams terminates you, you can ask a court of appeals to consider the case for possible appeal.  If she terminated you improperly or if there was a clear error in law, they should let you appeal.\n\n</p><p />As for appeal rights that are waived on entering drug court: Judge Williams has drug court participants sign a waiver saying that they will not recuse her from their case \"irrespective of defendant's success or failure\" in the program.  The waiver means she is the judge on termination hearings.  As I stated in our broadcast, this goes against the standards and recommendations of the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, which recommend that a judge allow a defendant to recuse him or her from termination hearings.\n\n\n</p><p /><strong>2.  Kim Spead</strong>\n\n</p><p />On our website and in the transcript of the radio story I stated that Kim Spead was kicked out of drug court for not paying her drug court fees, and then served 12 months for her original crime.  Reviewing the court documents, I believe this is not correct.  Although she did serve 12 months, it was not because she was kicked out of drug court.  I believe she was not kicked out.  \n\n</p><p />So what did she serve 12 months for?  \n\n</p><p />It appears to be for the crime stated in the original bench warrant that put her in jail: for violating \"the terms and conditions of the Drug Court sentence and the Drug Court Contract as follows: failure to appear for court on May 6, 2003.\"  Kim hadn't paid her fees and was summoned to court about it on that day.  \n\n</p><p />In addition, I originally stated on our website that Kim agreed to pay extra drug court fees AFTER she graduated drug court, but it was before.  \n\n</p><p />We've posted a <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/430/very-tough-love/extra\">corrected version</a> on the site.\n\n</p>"

It began as a program to give job skills to young people and has grown to the point where they even operate a middle school/high school inside the Baltimore City school system. \n \n</p><p />\"We tried to think of a fun event we could do as a fundraiser for Civic Works and came up with what is basically a movie night of stories from our <em>This American Life</em> TV show.   I've done versions of this event three times now, most recently this weekend in DC, and each time it's amazing to see the stories on a big screen. Our cinematographer shot them like a movie, and they're kind of gorgeous up there. \n \n</p><p />\"I know most of our radio fans have never seen the TV show, so if you're in the area I hope you'll come out.  We'll talk a little about Civic Works that night too: if you don't know about them, I think you'll be as impressed as I am.  It's a good cause.  If you want to really help them out, we're doing a reception before the show too, which will not be as good as sitting down with each and every one of you for a crab cake/shrimp salad club sandwich at <a href=\"http://www.missshirleys.com/menu/lunch.php\">Miss Shirley's</a>, but hopefully will come close.\n\n</p><p /><strong>Tuesday night, May 3rd, 7:30<br />\n            College of Notre Dame, 4701 N.

I crib those phrases, by the way, from <a href=\"http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/122867/npr-hosts-journalists-appalled-by-ron-schillers-comments/\">the open letter</a> our colleagues at NPR issued last week condemning his comments.  But Ron Schiller is not a journalist, and what he said is very different from the reporting on the Tea Party and everything else you hear on our air every day.  \n\n</p><p>\"Since I said all this on <em>On The Media</em>, I've gotten a number of very thoughtful emails from conservative listeners saying they like public radio a lot, and listen all the time, but they hear a bias.  I've asked for examples and I hope to get permission from them to post the emails they've sent in response.  \n\n</p><p>\"Does public radio have a left-wing bias?  Am I wrong about all this?    I think the best source of information on the subject is probably our own conservative listeners, who make up roughly a third of our audience (another third calls themselves middle of the road and a third is liberal).   Conservatives: what do you hear that makes you wince? Can you think of specific examples of a public radio news story you found biased?  <em>On The Media</em> is coming back to this next week, hoping to evaluate whether public radio is biased and if so, how biased, and they might find your comments useful. \n \n</p><p>\"Please comment on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thislife\">our Facebook page</a>, or join the conversation at <a href=\"http://www.onthemedia.org/episodes/2011/03/11/segments/159052\"><em>On the Media</em></a>, or, if you prefer a less public forum, send your thoughts to <a href=\"mailto:press@thislife.org?subject=On%20The%20Media\">press@thislife.org</a>.\"</p>"

It's a really great organization, and their <a href=\"http://www.nywriterscoalition.org/2011/01/raffle-win-a-singing-phone-telegram-from-jack-black-daily-show-tickets-and-signed-books/\">fundraiser</a> on Monday, Feb 7 is kind of mind-blowing with all the stuff that's up for grabs.  There's a raffle where the prizes include Jack Black doing a singing telegram on your phone and four VIP tickets to The Daily Show and signed books by David Rakoff.  Plus they're throwing a <a href=\"http://www.nywriterscoalition.org/2010/12/nywcs-fifth-annual-red-black-party-returns/\">\"red and black\" party</a> with a silent auction.  Some of the stuff in that auction: Drinks with me, a Freaks and Geeks DVD set signed by Judd Apatow and Paul Feig, a Buffy DVD set signed by Joss Whedon, a Mad Men pilot script signed by cast member Rich Sommer, autographed books from Michael Chabon and Chuck Klosterman, a handwritten page of music by Philip Glass, signed by him.  The party's in New York this coming Monday.  The <a href=\"http://www.nywriterscoalition.org/2011/01/raffle-win-a-singing-phone-telegram-from-jack-black-daily-show-tickets-and-signed-books/\">raffle</a> you can do from anywhere.  $10.

It's a fundraiser for <a href=\"http://826nyc.org/\">826NYC</a>,  one of the literacy groups founded by Dave Eggers (it has a special focus on getting kids to write).  The tournament winner gets a seat at the World Series of Poker.  No kidding.  That normally costs $10,000. So the best case scenario: you win a seat at the biggest poker tournament in the country.  Worst case:  you give $500 to a nice charity.  Win-win, right?\n</p>"

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of foreign reporting for me, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve realized. With foreign stories, so much gets pushed out, even if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a whole hour: time gets eaten up trying to orient listeners, cover key backstories, explain conflicts, mix in translation. Good tape gets chucked\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand then, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re me, it gets chewed over in your brain later...</em>\n</p>"

We'll be on Sundays at 11PM, heading up an overnight lineup of international programming.  CBC Radio One will air a mixture of favorite episodes from our archive and newly produced shows. \n</p>\n<p>\nCheck out <a href=\"http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/breakingnews/ira-glass-touts-canadian-roots-of-this-american-life-as-it-makes-cbc-debut-113031524.html\">this article</a> to read about Ira Glass's thoughts on airing in Canada. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This American Life</em> actually has some strong Canadian roots. Toronto native <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/paul-tough\">Paul Tough</a>, an early producer, helped come up with the concept for the show. Regular contributor <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/david-rakoff\">David Rakoff</a> hails from Montreal.  And former producer/frequent contributor <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/contributors/jonathan-goldstein\">Jonathan Goldstein</a> hosts his own CBC show, <em><a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/wiretap/\">Wiretap</a></em>.

        "description": "In our <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/422/comedians-of-christmas-comedy-special\">Comedians of Comedy Christmas Special</a> that aired a couple of weeks ago, we posited that \"there aren't that many holiday jokes.\" We stand corrected. (Have a good one to add to the collection? <a href=\"mailto:web@thislife.org\">Email us!</a>)<br /><br />\n\n<b>From Chuck W:</b><br />\nHere's one from my Catholic Grammar School:<br /><br />\n\nQ: What are Santa's helpers called?<br />\nA: Subordinate Clauses!<br /><br />\n\n<b>From Melissa B:</b><br />\nRudolph the Red was a Viking. One day he was sitting with his wife, eating lunch, and he looked out the window. \"Looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to rain,\" he said. His wife looked out. \"No way,\" she replied. Rudolph the Red stood and insisted, \"Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear.\"<br /><br />\n\n<b>From Michael M:</b><Br />\nWhen four of Santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce\ntoys as fast as the regular ones, and Santa began to feel the Pre-Christmas\npressure. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which\nstressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found\nthat three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the\nfence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the\nsleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and\nall the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup\nof apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he\ndiscovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. In his\nfrustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into\nhundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get\nthe broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the\nbroom. Just then the doorbell rang, and irritated Santa marched to the door,\nyanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas\ntree. The angel said very cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn't this a\nlovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to\nstick it?' And so began the tradition of the little angel on top of the\nChristmas tree.<br /><br />\n\n<b>From Megan B:</b><br />\nQ: Where do gingerbread men sleep?<br />\n A: On cookie sheets!<br /><br />\n\n Q: Why does Rudolph have an umbrella?<br />\n A: Because he's a rain-deer!<br /><br />\n\n<b>From anonymous:</b><br />\nHere is one I remember from my kidhood (told by a minister):<br /><br />\n \n Did you hear they canceled Christmas?<br />\n Joseph confessed.<br /><br />\n \n And then there's the song from the Smothers' Brothers:<br />\n You better not shout<br />\n you better not cry<br />\n you better not pout<br />\n I'm tellin' you why<br />\n Santa Claus is dead.<br /><br />\n\n<b>From Dan L:</b><br />\n Here's my favorite Christmas joke:<br /><br />\n\n Q: What did one snowman say to the other snowman?<br />\n A: Do you smell carrots?<br /><br />\n\n<b>From <a href=\"http://theavarice.blogspot.com\">Whitney A</a>:</b><br />\n A man in Scotland calls his son in London the day before Christmas Eve and says, \"I hate to ruin your day but I have to tell you that your mother and I are divorcing; forty-five years of misery is long enough\".<br /><br />\n\n \"Dad, what are you talking about?'\" the son screams.<br /><br />\n\n \"We can't stand the sight of each other any longer\", the father says. \u00c2\u00a0\"We're sick of each other and I'm sick of talking about this, so you can call your sister in Leeds and tell her\".<br /><br />\n\n Frantically, the son calls his sister, who explodes on the phone, \"Like hell they're getting divorced\", she shouts, \"I'll take care of this\".<br /><br />\n\n She calls Scotland immediately and screams at her father, \"You are NOT getting divorced. Don't do a single thing until I get there. I'm calling my brother back and we'll both be there tomorrow. \u00c2\u00a0Until then, don't do a thing, \u00c2\u00a0DO YOU HEAR ME?\" and hangs up.<br /><br />\n\n The old man hangs up his phone and turns to his wife.<br />\n \"Done! They're coming for Christmas&mdash;and they're paying their own way.\"<br /><br />\n\n<b>Kenneth W. adds:</b><br />\nDuring the Christmas show, the child asked why the reindeer crossed the\nroad and answered \"to get to the antler station.\" I have some insight into\nthis joke. Once I told my four-year-old daughter a joke I had heard on the\njoke episode of A Prairie Home Companion. Possibly it was told by Paula\nPoundstone: Why did the turtle cross the road? To get to the Shell station.<br /><br />\n\nWhenever I ask this riddle to my daughter, she laughs, but I don't think\nshe understands that Shell is a gasoline company that sells its products at\nShell stations.. She simply thinks it funny for a turtle to go to a shell\nstation.<br /><br />\n\nThen she starts to ask her own riddles that she invents based on the\nanimal station motif: Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the egg\nstation. Why did the dog cross the road? Do get to the puppy station. \u00c2\u00a0It\ngoes on and on.<br /><br />\n\nSo when I heard that boy answer \"to get to the antler station,\" I thought\nthat the Shell station joke must have taken hold among children everywhere,\nand thus, he invented one of his own."

Not just obviously hard stuff like our Iraq show,  where we sent two reporters into Iraq for a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most expensive thing we've ever done.  Or like our NUMMI show, which required tracking down dozens of carworkers from the 1980's to tell this amazing bit of history. We also did lots of hard stuff simply because it seemed like it would be incredibly fun: a full hour of stories pitched by our parents, an original Broadway song to accompany our investigative report about Magnetar, an hour in small-town Georgia doing stories inspired by an old newspaper column, the tale of a petty dictator who worked from a school maintenance office in Schenectady.</em>\n\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>And in addition to the price of producing the stories, it costs our home radio station WBEZ Chicago more than $150,000 per year for the bandwidth for our podcast and web streaming.</em>\n</p> \n<p>\n<em>We're trying to prove that you can do expensive, difficult stories, give them away on the Internet, and people will pitch in to pay for it.</em> \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>I hope you believe in that idea too at least a little, and have been happy enough with this year's shows that you're willing to help us fund them. Throw us a dollar, or five dollars, or ten. It's cheap, it's only fair and we will work long hours and use everything we know to turn the money into great stories.</em> \n</p>\n<em>You can donate online at our <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=5741&amp;5741.donation=form1\">website</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=b75L4MtfbOq4PqkTq1lAaULK9elqHpV03O1qPpBgoZv9ZxBWcFLc6NuZSMu&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d9384d85353843a619606282818e091d0\">Paypal</a>.

He plays long excerpts. How did Maron beat <em>Fresh Air</em> and our show to this idea?  Amazing.  Jerry Seinfeld before he was a megastar: charming and honest.  Jay Leno: sort of a dick, even talking to a high school kid.<br /><br />\n\nOr the road trip Marc takes <a href=\"http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode_72_maria_bamford\" target=\"_blank\">with Maria Bamford</a> where she talks about her last relationship and what was fucked up about it, and Marc realizes that it was a lot like his failed marriage, and suddenly feels like he's hearing his ex-wife's side of everything she went through with him.<br /><br />\n\nOr truly revealing, entertaining interviews with huge stars like Jerry Stiller or Robin Williams, where you hear them like they usually never talk in interviews, because they've known Maron for decades and hang out with him for an hour...or two of the most interesting hours of podcast I've ever heard (though maybe because I'm such a sucker for Louis CK), the <a href=\"http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-111-louis-ck-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> <a href=\"http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-112-louis-c-k-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">parter</a> with Louis where he not only talks about all kinds of weird filmmaking details but actually cries. <br /><br />\n\n<a href=\"http://wtfpod.libsyn.com/episode-117-ira-glass\" target=\"_blank\">I'm in his podcast</a> this week.  I was excited to do it because I'm such a fan, thanks to my wife, who is my portal for all things comedy and come to think of it pretty much anything else I watch or listen to.  <br /><br />\n\nBeing interviewed by Maron reminded me of an old axiom about interviewing: that an interview is a party you're throwing and your guest will mirror your behavior.  Marc is an insanely intense guy, and stares into you as you talk&mdash;it really feels like his eyes are piercing inside you&mdash;and then when he speaks he reaches inside himself and talks in the most heartfelt way possible.  In a room with that, you'd have to be made of stone not to respond in the most soulful way you can summon up.  He's emotionally present and he makes you emotionally present.  I don't think that's any kind of calculated move, it's who he is when he's performing.  And of course it gets amazing results.  <br /><br />\n\nAnother fun fact: he records the thing on a little digital recorder, with two handheld mics attached by long mic cords.  The mics he uses are the kind a comedian uses onstage.  So as the interviewee, you hold a mic like a standup comedian would the whole time.  Very comfortable I'm sure, for all the standups he talks to."

App ratings tend to skew to the negative, partly because you're prompted  to write reviews when you uninstall an app, and we're hoping to get a more accurate picture of how it's working. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you use the app but haven't updated to version 2, you really should. It includes cool new features like offline listening, background listening and marking episodes as heard. If you don't have the app, it's only three bucks to <a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=QNAY93oR8Vk&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fthis-american-life%252Fid348530331%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30\">download</a>. \n</p>\nIf you'd like to send direct feedback about the This American Life iPhone app, email <a href=mailto:\"talappfeedback@prx.org\">talappfeedback@prx.org</a>.

It's part of a charity show to raise money for the American Bird Conservancy, one of the groups trying to restore the ecosystem of the Gulf in the wake of the BP oil spill. \n</p>\n<p>\nIt seems like it's going to be an amazing show of comedians and musicians, plus Rachel and me.  I'll be interviewing her on stage.  I have things I've wanted to ask her for years.  I'm very very excited.  I'm told she's also going to sing.  \n</p>\n<p>\nOther performers:\n</p>\n<p>\nMike Birbiglia (who has been on our radio show many times)<br />\nTig Notaro (who's this standup comedian I just love, who's also on The Sarah SIlverman Program)<br />\nLucy Wainwright Roche (singer/songwriter)<br />\nErin McKeown (singer/songwriter)<br />\nMichelle Collins (from VH1's Best Week Ever)<br />\nGabe Delahaye (of Videogum)<br />\nJamie Kilstein (from Citizen Radio)<br />\nRob Lathan (Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, The Colbert Report, etc.)<br />\nBarkuna (that's a band)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hosts are Christina Gausas and Scott Adsit.  Adsit you may recognize from 30 Rock.  Gausas was a regular on Conan O'Brien, and has done comedy lots of other places.  They have a regular improv show together at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, probably the most sophisticated, funny improv show I've ever seen.   \n</p>\n<p>\nYou can buy seats <a href=\"http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/03004507B5E458AC?artistid=806149&majorcatid=10005&minorcatid=0\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne night only!

That seemed like something he should probably ask, not me, so we arranged for me to interview him over the phone two days before the speech.  He told me how he didn't like the GF when he first met her at church, she didn't seem interested in current events, he was very judgey:</p>\n\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-misjudges.mp3\">Pop-up Player</a></div>\n<p><audio src=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-misjudges.mp3\"></audio></p>\n\n<p>She was \"very pretty, very fashionable,\" one of those \"pretty, popular girls.\"  Right.  And who likes that? But they were out with friends getting lunch after church or bible study one week and Mike mentioned our radio show and Kathy turned out to be an expert on the show, which made him start to think differently of her:</p>\n\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-kathy-tal.mp3\">Pop-up Player</a></div>\n<p><audio src=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-kathy-tal.mp3\"></audio></p>\n\n<p>Didn't hurt her feelings about him either.  And so he choose my speech as the setting to ask her to marry him.  At the event, I played clips of our conversation, including the moment he asked her &mdash; on tape &mdash; to marry him.</p> \n\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-kathy-question.mp3\">Pop-up Player</a></div>\n<p><audio src=\"http://podcast.thisamericanlife.org/special/mike-kathy-question.mp3\"></audio></p>\n\n<p>The audience went nuts.  Kathy was all \"how is this happening?\"  We brought up the house lights and then brought them onstage.  It was amazing.  I got all choked up and had a hard time continuing the speech.</p>\n<p>After the show they came backstage and we took these pictures.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/MikeKathy.jpg\" alt=\"Mike and Kathy\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/MikeKathyIra.jpg\" alt=\"Mike, Kathy, and Ira\" /></p>"

It wasn't an intimidating venue.  He was playing with a sextet at the Apple Store in Soho, a show that was recorded to sell on the iTunes store.\n</p>\n<p>\nI do a piece that Philip used to perform onstage with Allen Ginsberg.  They were close friends.  It's Ginsberg's poem \"Wichita   Vortex Sutra\" set to a piano score.  I love this poem and know well the original recording they did of it together.  It was incredibly fun to read the poem while Philip played next to me, and here's the thing I can tell you about reading onstage with my cousin the famous composer:  he plays really really loud.  It's like reading a poem next to a helicopter.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can get my piece, or the whole concert, <a href=\"http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=QNAY93oR8Vk&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Falbum%252Fwichita-vortex-sutra-feat%252Fid359941497%253Fi%253D359941584%2526uo%253D6%2526partnerId%253D30\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you go to the site, the most amazing parts of the show were the excepts from Symphony No. 3 played by the sextet.

        "description": "<p>\nOver the last several months we've tried to do an especially ambitious run of shows: investigative reports, an original Broadway song, the history of GM told through one car plant that could've saved the company, Rest Stop, #1 Party School, and the show where we all produced stories pitched by our parents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to name just a few. All these shows were trying new things, some of them hardcore, old-fashioned journalism, some just for fun. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn this brave new media economy that we all live in, we're trying to prove that you can do expensive, ambitious stories like this, give them away for free on the Internet, and people will pitch in to pay for it. \n</p>\n<p>\nI hope you believe in that idea too at least a little, and have been happy enough with this run of shows that you're willing to help us fund it. <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=4640&4640.donation=form1\">Throw us a dollar, or five dollars, or ten</a>, and help us prove that this way to fund stories can work! \n</p>\n<p>\nYou can <a href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?df_id=4640&4640.donation=form1\">donate on the internet</a>... or by text!

        "description": "<img src=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/sites/default/files/mount-pleasant.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Pleasant\" style=\"float: left;margin: 0 12px 6px 0;\" />\n<p>In our story about California Gubernatorial Candidate Steve Poizner, we mentioned questions about sales figures for his book <em><a href=\"http://stevepoizner.com/mountpleasant\">Mount Pleasant</a></em>. Just after its release, Poizner's book shot to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">No. 5</a> on the New York Times Best-Seller List.</p>\n\n<p>During his interview, Ira Glass asked Poizner if he or the campaign had bought a bunch of copies of the book to boost sales. At that time, Mr. Poizner confirmed that the campaign did buy copies for supporters, but said he could not provide a specific number. He then told Ira his campaign would make the figure available.</p>\n\n<p>After the interview, a few things happened. <em>Mount Pleasant</em> dramatically dropped to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">No. 33</a> on the very next New York Times Best-Seller List. As instructed by Mr. Poizner, we asked the campaign how many copies it purchased, but the campaign would not provide a number.</p>\n\n<p>Then, Malcolm Maclachlan, a reporter with Capitol Weekly\u00e2\u20ac\u201da paper focused on California politics\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsent us a story he wrote after hearing our story about the controversy surrounding Poizner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book. Looking into sales of <em>Mount Pleasant</em>, he found some very strange things\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthings that raise more questions about book's brief rise onto the best-seller list.</p>\n\n<p>In his article, which you can read <a href=\"http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_c=ysyzceas1j1qqy&xid=ysyfbxbaesxv63&done=.yt0thwcmc7kvb4\">here</a>, Maclachlan reports that a significant number of people seem to have inexplicably received copies of Poizner's book. One college student in San Diego named Matthew Donnellan says he was confused when he received a copy of <em>Mount Pleasant</em>. Donnellan got more confused when he looked to see who paid for it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6[He] noticed that his name and address were listed not only as the recipient but as the buyer on the invoice. Wanting to make sure his credit card number hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been stolen, he called Amazon. The Amazon representative he reached told him the book was purchased with a gift card \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that card had also been used to buy copies of \"<em>Mount Pleasant</em>\" for 249 other people, all of whom had first names that began with \"M.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It was like they were going down a mailing list,\" Donnellan said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maclachlan reports that the gift card appears to have been purchased under a phony name by someone affiliated with a book promotions company called <a href=\"http://www.resultsource.com/\">ResultsSource</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The implication is that the company may have disguised a large promotional purchase of the book by using gift cards to buy copies for large numbers of individuals on a mailing list. </p>\n\n<p>This is interesting because leading entities that rank book sales make an effort not to count bulk sales in their rankings. The idea is to prevent promotions companies and authors from buying a bunch of copies and forcing their book onto best-seller lists. Sales that appeared to go to individuals through a retailer like Amazon, however, would be counted. They would then boost a book's sales figures and ranking.</p>\n\n<p>Maclachlan reached out the ResultSource and the Poizner campaign about his findings. The Poizner campaign refused to discuss the matter. The promotions company did not return his phone calls.</p>"

The answer is we don't know. But there have been lots of great reporters doing great work on this area of wall street for some time. Wall Street Journal reporters Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp wrote about a disastrous Magnetar CDO all the way back in late 2007. And Gretchen Morgenson has been writing about Goldman Sachs in the New York Times for some time as well. Pro Publica's investigation uncovered a wealth of heretofore unreported information, like how many CDO's Magnetar sponsored, how much they were worth, and the fact that it was pushing for riskier assets to go into them. In addition, the breadth and depth of their inquiry fleshed out the larger story of what was happening on Wall Street in the CDO world.\n</p>"

        "description": "<p>\nIra Glass writes:\n</p>\n<p>\nWatching musicians record the original Broadway song for <a href=\"/radio-archives/episode/405/inside-job\">this week's radio show</a> was like watching a seasoned SWAT team at work.  It was all so fast!\n</p>  \n<p>\nAll this happened in the late afternoon, in a recording studio right by all the big Broadway theaters, so the performers could go straight from the session to their shows that night: The Addams Family, Chicago, La Cage Aux Folles.  One of the singers, Christian Borle, was off to dance on the ceiling as Bert in Mary Poppins.  \n</p>\n<p>\nIt's hard to write about all this without gushing in a very uncritical way.  It was just really fun to watch these people who are so good at their jobs.  The song was written by Robert Lopez, who co-wrote Avenue Q and is writing a new musical with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.  Our musical director was Stephen Oremus, the musical director of Avenue Q and Wicked.  Orchestrations were by Bruce Coughlin, who created the orchestrations for 9 to 5, Grey Gardens, Urinetown, revivals of Annie Get Your Gun and Guys and Dolls.  Singer John Tracey Eagan was one of the people who took over as Max Bialystock, the lead in The Producers, after Nathan Lane left the show, and for this recording he definitely amped up the Nathan Laniness.  \n</p>\n<p>\nTo record, first they did piano, bass, drums and synthesizer (for strings and a timpani roll at the end), plus the two vocalists, John and Christian.  I was surprised that they all perform together, the vocalists singing along with the musicians, but everyone told me this is part of the Broadway sound.  They only did two or three takes.  Even the first take was pretty close.  Then the woodwinds, again just a couple takes.  Then the horns.  Everyone would have played together but the studio was too small for that.  John Kilgore had the thing mixed and finished five hours after we walked in the door, though Robert and Stephen had little fixes the next day.

But I found that reading NYU's full list was surprisingly moving.  So many of these stories opened my eyes to things I hadn't known about or fully understood, written and executed with amazing style and understated force. I took inspiration especially from these, during this past decade: James Fallows, Errol Morris, Michael Lewis, David Foster Wallace, Malcolm Gladwell, Atul Gawande, Seymour Hersch, Elizabeth Kolbert, Ron Suskind, George Packer, Alex Gibney and Eva Orner."

        "description": "Hi everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u201d<br><br>Ira here. &nbsp;Philip Glass, the iconic composer of operas and film scores who\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere's no non-weird way to say this\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis also my cousin, is doing a live performance at the Apple Store in Soho this Thursday, January 21st. &nbsp;Apple is filming it and is going to offer the video on iTunes at some point, maybe that same day for all I know.<br><br>I've been asked to perform a piece that Allen Ginsberg used to perform with Philip, Ginsberg's great Vietnam-era poem \"Wichita Vortex Sutra.\" &nbsp;Philip set it to music years ago, and there are a few great recordings of them performing it together, which you are just a google search away from, or try this <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNGWKU2RJ0E&amp;feature=related\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube clip</a>, and at this point by the way are we still supposed to capitalize Google when we use it as a verb or adjective?<div><br>I've performed this with Philip once before. &nbsp;He plays that piano a lot louder than you might think. &nbsp;It's like reading a poem inside a helicopter. &nbsp;It's also really fun. Ginsberg used to perform the thing with a beat poet grandeur I'd be embarrassed to attempt. &nbsp;When he calls down the gods in the second half of the poem, he really calls down the gods. &nbsp;Needless to say, it's kind of the opposite of talking on the radio, where the whole point is to sound off-hand and conversational. &nbsp;<br><br>I'm the smallest part of this event. &nbsp;Philip will be playing solo, and with cellist (also his GF) Wendy Sutter which is always fantastic and really emotional, and with his chamber group. &nbsp;Details:<br><br><strong>Thursday Jan 21st 7:00</strong>...Apple Store Soho 103 Prince Street New York City, NY 10012.<br><br>It's free. &nbsp;But you'd be smart to get there early.</div>"

        "description": "<a name=\"unwanted\"></a>After the <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1330\">#1 Party School</a> show aired, a half dozen people wrote to us complaining about our use of the phrase \"unwanted sex.\" It sounds like it means rape, so why weren't we using the term rape? They also criticized us for not talking more about sexual assaults on campuses. In case other listeners had the same questions, here's my response:<br><br>\"To be clear, our intention was in no way to speak of rape euphemistically, or to sidestep the issue. Rather, we used the term \"unwanted sexual experience\" because it duplicates the language used by Penn State University in its own annual student surveys. Here's the question students of both sexes were asked: \"Have you been a victim of an unwanted sexual experience?\" (Six percent of those surveyed in 2009 said yes.) A narrower survey, of just the first two months of 2009, asked these questions: Have you: \"Had sex when you didn't really want to?\" (9.4% said yes); \"Been pressured or forced to have sex with someone when you were too drunk to prevent it?\" (3.4%&nbsp;said yes); \"Pressured or forced someone to have sex with you after you had been drinking?\" (1.5% said yes).<br><br>\"While some of these incidents the students reported likely are rape, it's also safe to say that some of them aren't, and we wanted to be very careful not to misconstrue the data. This is the only data on sexual consequences/violence, as it relates to alcohol, that the university collects, so these were the only numbers, and terms, we felt we could use responsibly enough to broadcast.<br><br>\"What I do know, is that so far this academic year, eleven women have reported sexual assaults to the local police. That number is higher than it was this time last year. I did consider adding that number to the story, but since I had no evidence that those assaults involved drinking, and the show was about drinking, I didn't report it. <br><br>\"I do know that the majority of sexual assaults at colleges <em>do</em> involve alcohol, and maybe we should have said that. And perhaps I should have looked nationally to see if there's good, specific data linking drinking and rape on campuses. However, since we were mostly concentrating on stats at Penn State, we used what they had.\" <br><br>\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSarah Koenig (producer)"

        "description": "Dear listeners,<br><br>Last week, the economic crisis that we&#8217;ve been reporting on hit especially close to home. &#160;A dozen colleagues from our home radio station, WBEZ Chicago, had to be laid off. &#160;It costs the radio station around $150,000 per year just for the internet bandwidth to deliver the free podcast and web stream of&#160;<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This American Life</span>. That&#8217;s not staff. Not computers. Just the bandwidth. We really want the podcast to remain free, but the radio station cannot absorb these costs; that would mean more layoffs. So we&#8217;re asking for your help. &#160;We&#8217;re thrilled that last year, we were able to make up this entire bandwidth cost through thousands of small donations from listeners. So if you&#8217;re a regular podcast listener, or if you use this website a lot, please consider pitching in. You can <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?2740.donation=form1&amp;df_id=2740\" target=\"_blank\"><u><strong>donate online here</strong></u></a>.<br><br>Thank you very much.

We wouldn't be in the big televised ceremony that the stars are at; our categories were presented as part of the \"Creative Arts\" Emmys which includes all sorts of tech awards\u00e2\u20ac\u201dBest Sound Editing for a Series, Best Makeup Without Prosthetics, that kind of thing\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand some of the nonfiction and reality show awards. Since it wasn't the big Emmy ceremony, what was the big deal?<br><br>But then we got there and suddenly it seemed very big and official and there was a red carpet and actual TV stars and now we wanted to win very badly. <br><br>We lost the first three awards we were up for: Cinematography, Writing and Editing. It started to feel like this wasn't our crowd, like we weren't going to win anything. And then, when they read the nominees for Best Nonfiction Series, the camera man roaming the aisle next to me flipped through some notes and then trained his camera on James Lipton, the host of Inside the Actors Studio, one of our competitors. About a half-dozen of us saw this and we turned to each other and said \"Okay, we're dead.\" And then we won!&#160; When they called our names, it was truly a shock. It was like one of those movies where they fake you out with an ending where everything goes wrong and the main character dies and you're sad and then Aha! Psych! And everything works out great.&#160; It was very exciting.<br><br>Turns out the although this is not the big Emmys ceremony, this one will be broadcast next weekend on E!<br><br>Pictured:&#160;From left, cinematographer Adam Beckman, host Ira Glass and senior producer Julie Snyder backstage after winning the Emmy for Best Nonfiction Series.

But because so many people\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsometimes more than half a million\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare downloading and streaming our show each week, the Internet bandwidth to distribute the program this way costs $152,000 per year. We want to keep offering <em>This American Life</em> for free. You want us to keep offering the show for free. Our home station, Chicago Public Radio, doesn't need to make money on our podcast, but they can't lose $152,000 a year on it, either.<br><br>We think we can cover the whole cost by coming to you, hopefully just twice a year, virtual hat in hand. If you listen regularly over the Internet, <a class=update-body href=\"https://secure2.convio.net/wbez/site/Donation2?2740.donation=form1&amp;df_id=2740\" target=_blank>please pitch in a little cash</a>. To all the people who gave six months ago, a sincere thank you, and please consider giving a small amount again. A dollar from every Internet listener would more than pay for everything, but of course not everyone's going to give, so consider a $5 donation. It'll cover you and a few other people for a year of listening. If you donate more than a few bucks, you can choose thank-you gifts\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding some stuff you can't get anywhere else. One of the items is a CD of \"<a class=update-body href=\"http://thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355\">The Giant Pool of Money</a>,\" our incredibly popular, recent episode about the mortgage crisis, which many listeners wanted to purchase as a gift.<br><br>Our dream is that we'll get you and most of our Internet listeners to chip in at the $1 or $5 level, and that'll cover everything. We'd love to take care of this expense with a flood of little donations from the people who actually listen to our show this way. And of course, if you feel that getting an hour of our show every week is worth more to you than a dollar a year, we'd be grateful for anything else you'd care to contribute. We really want to keep the podcast free.<br><br>Thanks so much,<br>Ira Glass"

And it's cheap!<br><br>\nMy personal favorites, of the six episodes: Nancy Updike's story in <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/TV_Episode.aspx?episode=3\">Episode Three</a> about nonbelievers and believers colliding in Utah, the fourteen-year-old who decided he doesn't believe in love in <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/TV_Episode.aspx?episode=2\">Episode Two</a>, and Chris Ware's cartoon and GJ Echternkamp's home movie in <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/TV_Episode.aspx?episode=4\">Episode Four</a>. If you download all six shows, you'll see us try all sorts of ways to film a story for TV and you'll probably notice us loosen up as we figure out what we're doing in this new medium.\nIt's been exciting trying to make a television program that would feel just like our radio show and I hope you take a look."

We found ourselves in the strange situation with last week's show, \"<a class=update-body href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=333\">The Center for Lessons Learned</a>,\" that we had a great story that was simply hard to hear over the radio. It's a phone call with a 20-year-old medical student in Baghdad, and the audio quality is a little too sketchy for radio, but not too terrible to hear sitting at a computer or\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven better\u00e2\u20ac\u201don iPod headphones. She says some amazing things, including a story about a U.S. soldier who was stationed in Iraq who she got to know over the Internet. He wanted to meet her in person, so he set up a fake roadblock and checkpoint on the route between her house and her school. We pinned this interview onto the end of the podcast of this episode, and we've also posted it as a separate, downloadable mp3.

Oh, sure, I winced at the typecasting, but it seemed like it'd be fun, so I did it. I like <a href=\"http://www.acceptable.tv\" target=_blank class=update-body>Acceptable.TV</a>, though it seems to be the worst-publicized show in the history of television. I have yet to meet anyone who's ever seen it or even heard of it. The surprisingly enjoyable premise of the show is that each week, they present five 'TV pilots,' and we in the audience vote for which ones we want to see again. Then the next week, two winners return with new episodes.<br><br>\n\n\"If you want to witness them at their full genius, go to their site and watch '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjTJPAUy-yo\" target=_blank class=update-body>Homeless James Bond</a>' or '<a href=\"http://www.acceptable.tv/contest/tv/videos/1527-FBAbdullah\" target=_blank class=update-body>FBAbdullah</a>.' And is it okay to say on a public radio website that I loved a TV pilot they did called '<a href=\"http://www.acceptable.tv/videos/243-Who-Farted-\" target=_blank class=update-body>Who Farted?</a>' (If you watch that one, note the incredible and perfect music they created for it.)<br><br>\n\n\"The people who make the show seem to love everything about the conventions of television and to see through those conventions with piercing, critical, x-ray eyes&mdash;all at once. One of their go-to moves that I especially love is that many of the sketches end on these fake-sincere moments where the characters have tender, TV-sized heartstrings moments. The one in 'FBAbdullah' is sort of a classic, but in the very same episode there's also one in '<a href=\"http://www.acceptable.tv/contest/tv/videos/1526-Gayliens\" target=_blank class=update-body>Gayliens</a>' and another in '<a href=\"http://www.acceptable.tv/contest/tv/videos/1547-Operation-Kitten-Calendar-4\" target=_blank class=update-body>Operation Kitten Calendar</a>.' I don't think I've seen other sketch comedies do this as well (or certainly as often). It gives the sketches (excuse me, the 'pilots') satisfying endings, which apparently is a tricky thing to do in sketch comedy. The cartoon I'm in is the fifth episode with Mr. Sprinkles. He's a <i>Cat in the Hat</i> figure who enters kids' homes when it rains, inevitably terrifying the kids. They always call the cops, which is how he ended up in prison.\""

So we were thrilled that so many people came out, and even more thrilled to read the positive feedback on your blogs (thanks, Google Alerts!).<br /><br />It was more technologically complex than anything we'd ever attempted\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith shots from five HD cameras intercut live, video playback, Ira synching audio to visuals, and everything beamed onto 330 screens across the country. We're amazed that nothing exploded.<br /><br />Oh, and remember when Ira read the wedding proposal from the guy in a theater in Peoria? She said yes.<br /><br />We weren't able to send spies to every theater, so tell us what you thought of the show! Leave us comments on <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/thisamericanlifespace\" target=_blank>MySpace</a> and&#160;<a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/This-American-Life/20778076336\" target=_blank>Facebook</a>, and add your photos to&#160;our <a class=\"update-body\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/officialthisamericanlife\" target=_blank>Flickr pool</a> (Tag 'em tal-live, and give us some details in the description, willya?)! <br /><br />Thanks, again, to everyone who joined us on Thursday. You're awesome!<br /><br /><i>Pictured: The satellite truck that made the whole shebang possible. Photo by Seth Lind.</i></td> </tr></table>"

So for our 500th, we bring you the best of This American Life &mdash; the way we've been hearing it, behind the scenes, all these years.",

This was during a time when the New York Fed was trying to become a stronger regulator, so that it wouldn't fail to miss another financial crisis like it did with the meltdown in 2008. As part of that effort to reform, the Fed had commissioned a highly confidential report, written by Columbia professor David Beim, that identified why the regulator failed in the years leading up to the crisis. Beim laid out specific recommendations for how the Fed could fix its problems. Carmen's recordings allow us to see if the Fed successfully heeded those recommendations more than two years later.

        "body": "Ira explains that in May 2013, the FBI shot a guy named Ibragim Todashev in his living room in \nFlorida. Supposedly, right before he died, Todashev implicated himself in a crime, a pretty \ngruesome one, a triple murder of three drug dealers in Waltham Massachusetts, a Boston suburb.  \nLaw enforcement officials told reporters that he also named one of the alleged Boston Marathon \nbombers \u2013 Tamerlan Tsarnaev \u2013 as his accomplice in the crime. And then, right before he signed \na confession, he supposedly freaked out, and an FBI agent shot him. Which is weird in itself. But \nweirder still is the fact that the FBI has been silent about what happened. They first promised an \ninvestigation on this last May. And since then, we\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s coming, but nine months later it hasn\u2019t arrived. So many questions remain: what happened during that interrogation that led to them shooting Ibragim Todashev? If they had such good evidence connecting him to these \nmurders, why didn\u2019t they just arrest him? What evidence did they have? How good is the evidence \nconnecting the alleged Boston bomber to the murders? Do they truly know who committed the \ntriple murders? In the absence of solid information, conspiracy theories sprang up. Some people \nstarted to believe the FBI was hiding something.  \n(7 minutes)",

Growers would pay for little zip-ties they could put around the base of their marijuana plants, and the cops would know to leave them alone. It saved time and generated revenue. Reporter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marycuddehe\">Mary Cuddehe</a> tells the story of how the county and the nation responded to the sheriff's plan. (18 minutes)",

The rise in disability isn't just \nhappening in Hale County but in pockets all over the country.  14 million people are now receiving disability payments.  And it's a number that is growing.

Yesterday we got an answer &mdash; and it demonstrates how the state's huge House of Representatives is so very representative, so responsive to shifts in public mood. After giving Republicans a three-to-one majority in the House and Senate in 2010, voters have swung the other way. Here's what we know so far: Early numbers have the Democrats taking 217 seats to the Republicans' 177, with six seats still undetermined. Speaker Bill O'Brien won his House seat, but he won't be speaker again, because Republicans not only lost their majority, they lost the House entirely. Reporters in New Hampshire are saying that Bill O'Brien won't be seeking any leadership position at all.",

Ira reports on a mother and daughter in\nChicago, Barbara and Aniya McDonald, who have been working with a program\ndesigned to help them improve their relationship &mdash; and ultimately to put\nAniyah in a strong position to learn non-cognitive skills.

We stated that according to FBI statistics, about 10 percent of hate crimes in 2009 were against Muslims.  In fact, about 10 percent of religiously-motivated hate crimes were against Muslims.  It was 128 of the 1,376 religiously-motivated hate crimes that year (9.3 percent).  In all, there were 7,789 hate crime offenses in 2009, so incidents against Muslims were 1.6% of the total, which is tiny.  That same year, there were 2,724 hate crimes against blacks, 798 hate crimes against gay men and 964 hate crimes against Jews, according to the FBI.

It turns out this kind of gossip is the basis for a huge research project about AIDS in Malawi. For 10 years, a sociologist named Susan Watkins has been collecting journals filled\nwith gossip about  AIDS. Watkins hired local people to write the journals&mdash;to just listen to what people were saying in their communities about the virus, and then write it down. What Watkins learned from reading them bucked much of the conventional wisdom about how rural Africans were dealing with the epidemic.

        "body": "\n&lt;!--\n.indented\n   {\n   padding-left: 25pt;\n   padding-right: 25pt;\n   }\n-->\n\n\n<p>This week's story about Coca-Cola is actually a knockoff of <a href=\"http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mince-pie-the-real-american-pie/Content?oid=1267308\">a story</a> by historian Cliff Doerksen about Mince Pie, in which he tells the truly surprising story of how:</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">\nTo its 19th- and early-20th-century admirers, mince pie was \"unquestionably the monarch of pies,\" \"the great American viand,\" \"an American institution\" and \"as American as the Red Indians.\" It was the food expatriates longed for while sojourning abroad. Acquiring an appreciation for it was proof that an immigrant was becoming assimilated. It was the indispensable comfort dish dispatched to American expeditionary forces in World War I to reinforce their morale with the taste of home.</p> \n<p>\nThen he arrives at the magnificent thesis of his article:\n</p>\n<p class=\"indented\">Most remarkably, mince pie achieved and maintained its hegemony despite the fact that everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding those who loved it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dagreed that it reliably caused indigestion, provoked nightmares, and commonly afflicted the overindulgent with disordered thinking, hallucinations, and sometimes death.\n</p>\nAnd then the fun begins. Fantastic anecdotes. Stuff you've never heard or imagined. It's encyclopedic knowledge, served up with bemusement and a pleasing and dark sense of amazement about the world. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn the article Cliff makes two mince pies according to old recipes and is stunned at how much beef fat and sugary crap went into them. In those pre-refrigeration days, that's what kept the meat in the pie from spoiling. He builds the narrative suspense\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhat will these monstrosities taste like?\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbefore arriving at the story's climactic surprise: they're delicious!  The story won the 2010 prize that's like the Oscars for food writers: the James Beard Award.  It's a completely entertaining, enlightening story, and I tried to talk Cliff into doing the same thing with this Coca-Cola recipe for our show back in December.  Yes, okay, basically I wanted him to rip off his own great story for our benefit.  Then on December 17th, he died unexpectedly at the age of 47.  Doing this story, flying around the country with producer Ben Calhoun, it was hard to stop thinking about what a funny, fascinating job Cliff \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a real historian as well as a sharp, witty prose stylist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would've made of it.  He's greatly missed.\n</p>",

Scientists estimate that the parasites outnumber us and our free-living allies by 3 to 1.

The host of <em>About Cars</em> was so upset about this \u2014 and what he felt was mistreatment in the past \u2014 that he not only refused to move, he started a monthly newsletter about it and organized a public rally. Fifteen hundred people wrote angry letters; 126 swore they'd never give to Wisconsin Public Radio again. The State Legislature got involved. They conducted an audit, which took months. There were hearings. One definition of a fiasco is when something simple and small turns horribly large, and this event fits the bill.

        "body": "The story of a White House scandal from the year 1881. President James Garfield lay dying of a gunshot wound during that summer. But because our nation is crazy when it comes to the President, and because the White House is a national movie screen onto which we project a whole array of fears and misplaced idealism, Americans projected one of the big fears of the day onto Garfield. Namely, the fear of sewer gas. Rumors abounded that Garfield was not dying from the bullet in his back, but from vapors rising from the antiquated White House toilets. It became so serious that an independent expert was brought in to give a bipartisan assessment of the problem. The Senate voted to spend $300,000 to build a new White House, a sanitary one, right next to the original White House. And it would be nice to believe that all of this was the kind of hysteria that was only possible before the germ theory of disease was proven. But in fact, now we know how diseases are transmitted. Now that we know that there's no such thing as \"sewer gas.\" But still, when it comes to germs, and our fear of disease, we are still irrational beings.

        "body": "It's possible that the very first teenager to heed his invitation was Hyder Akbar, 17, from Concord, California. In the summer of 2002, he travelled with his father to live in their home country. As luck would have it, he met a radio producer named Susan Burton before he left, and she gave him a tape recorder to take along. This show is devoted to his extraordinary recordings. In Kabul, Akbar learns to use a Kalashnikov and spends his days with his one-eyed war-hero uncle. By the end of the summer his father is appointed the official spokesman for the new Afghan government, which gives him insider's access to everything important that happens in Kabul. He meets warlords and sees the President. Hours after a bomb explodes in a market, he walks through the bloody, glass-strewn marketplace. <br /><br />\n\nA year later, in the summer of 2003, Hyder returned to Afghanistan and recorded stories that are, if anything, even more amazing than the ones in this show. That show, <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/254/teenage-embed-part-two\">Teenage Embed, Part Two</a>, takes place in Kunar province, where Hyder's dad was appointed governor. <br /><br />\n\nSusan Burton produced Hyder's audio diaries for the radio.

Every few weeks it seems like there's more news about how badly it's going: Senior Administration officials like Colin Powell now admit the insurgency in Iraq is growing; terror suspects like Yasir Hamdi (who supposedly were so dangerous that having a lawyer talk to them about their case would compromise national security) are released without trial because the evidence against them is so flimsy; there was the Abu Ghraib prison scandal; and just this week, the former head of the U.S. operation in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared the problem from the start was that there were not enough troops there. Host Ira Glass discusses whether the Bush Administration is simply not very skilled at fighting terror with Richard Perle and James Fallows. Perle was one of the early advocates in Administration circles of going to war in Iraq. During the run-up to the war, he was chairman of the Defense Policy Board, a civilian advisory panel in the Pentagon. Fallows is national correspondent for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, who has <a href=\"http://www.epic-usa.org/Default.aspx?tabid=185\">written extensively</a> on the planning and early problems in the war in Iraq.

With police prompting, he fingered a guy named Collin Warner as the shooter. No matter that everyone in the neighborhood said someone else murdered Hamilton and that Warner had nothing to do with it. And no matter that the teenager hadn't witnessed the murder at all. A jury convicted Warner, and he was sentenced to 15 years to life for killing a man he'd never even heard of. Carl, his childhood friend couldn't let it rest, and started to fight the conviction. He tells everyone he can about the case. He tracks down witnesses. He teaches himself to read court documents. Eventually, he gets a real estate lawyer hooked on the case. (29 minutes)",

Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It was a business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying illegal weapons for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes)",

Barely any poultry plants are represented by a union, especially in the South, where most of the plants are located. So worker rights advocates rely in large part on the church to help them organize workers. And in the past few years, they've been trying something new: They've been using the church to intervene with company management in a very, very personal way. <em>This American Life</em> producer Sarah Koenig tells the story of how one organizer tried this method with a manager at a company called Case Farms, and a plant they have in Morganton, North Carolina. You can learn more in the film <a href=\"http://fiegefilms.com/films/mississippi-chicken/\">Mississippi Chicken</a>, a documentary about poultry factory workers in Canton, Mississippi. (15 minutes)",

The community had been run by the notorious Warren Jeffs, now in prison for rape. Jeffs had been in charge of the FLDS church, and also of the giant trust which church members paid into all their lives.

But Wisan quickly ran into an enormous problem: The majority of people in Short Creek would have nothing to do with him or his ideas. Claire Hoffman reports.

Ira discusses the case with Aziz Huq, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School and co-author of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002V1GZL4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thiamelif-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002V1GZL4\">Unchecked and Unbalanced: Presidential Power in a Time of Terror</a>.</em> Huq says the Newburgh case isn't what it seems, because without the help of a government informant, the four men probably wouldn't have been able to organize an act of terrorism. The Newburgh case is part of a pattern of sting operations the government has undertaken since September 11th as part of its mandate to catch terrorists before they strike. The first big investigation to test this approach\u2014the case of Hemant Lakhani\u2014is the subject of today's show. (3 minutes).",

Then one day, sitting in a hotel room with a gangster he happened to know, the phone rang. It wasa business friend of the gangster's, calling from America. The man on the phone was rich, Lakhani was told. Maybe he would invest in Lakhani's latest venture. So Lakhani started talking to the man over the phone. Pretty soon they set up a meeting at a hotel in New Jersey, to talk business. But when Lakhani got there, the man seemed to be only interested in buying weapons. Illegal weapons, for Somali terrorists. Lakhani, always eager to make a deal, said he can help him out. What he didn't know, is that the supposed rich business man was an FBI informant, and that he had just walked into an elaborate government sting. Petra Bartosiewicz reports. (30 minutes)",
